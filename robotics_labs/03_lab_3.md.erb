title: Working with radians, Multiple Robots and Custom Messages
due: TBD
---
## Plan for today

* This lab will be a guided team programming session. You will be in a breakout room with your teammates and collaborate on the solutions.
* Please do the following during lab while we are around to help everyone solve their problems.
* The goal is that it takes 90 minutes but if you need the extra 30 minutes we will stick around

<%= callout("NB", " After completing each section, invite a TA into your breakout room so they can sign off", :small) %>

### Sections

1. Write this function, and write test cases for it.

<%= source_begin "language-python" %>

def best_turn_direction(current, target):
  """Given a current orientation and a target orientation, return optimal
     direction to turn.

     current -- current orientation in radians (positive or negative)
     target -- target orientation in radians (positive or negative)

     Returns:
     +1 if it's best to turn counterclockwise
     -1 if it's best to turn clockwise
     0 if no turn is required

     Examples:

     best_turn_direction(0, PI/2) => +1
     best_turn_direction(PI/2, 0) => -1
     best_turn_direction(PI/2, -PI/2) => -1
     best_turn_direction(-PI/2, PI/2) => +1
     (but there are much trickier cases)
  """
<%= source_end %>

1. Create a Gazebo world with three simulated robots in it, and write a very simple ROS program ti make them move. The simplest is if they all just respond to cmd_vels identically. So if they start next to each other, in theory they would all move together. Here is a page out of our [Lab notebook](https://campus-rover.gitbook.io/lab-notebook/faq/spawn_multiple_robots#author-belle-scott) which in turn has two further links.

2. Define a custom message (.msg), make the appropriate updates to CMakeFile and Package.xml. Write a trivial script that includes it so you can show the the python builds: Here's one reference, but there are many more: [Defining Custom Messages](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/DefiningCustomMessages)
