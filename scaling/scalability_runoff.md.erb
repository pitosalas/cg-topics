## Scalability Runoff

* A standard set of torture tests that each team's nT will be subjected to
* This is just one of many metrics that we will assess your team's work by

## Level Playing Field

* Any database, or services, or http server, are permitted
* Complete seed data set (we will check!)
* Any caching, queueing, etc are all ok
* But it all has to be at the $0 tier (except for db if you need it)
* No paying for extra powerful services!
