title: Test Fixtures

#### Fixtures
* Intro
  * Data or objects that exist exclusively for testing
  * Sometimes known as test or seed data
  * What is the role of data in developing tests for your application
* Where are they stored?
  * in memory (i.e. objects and classes)
  * on disk (i.e. files, images, ...)
  * in a database (i.e. records in a dbms)
* When are they created?
  * At "build" time, i.e. putting files in the right directories or adding records to an empty database
  * At "launch" time, i.e. when the app launches it creates the fixtures
  * At "test run time", i.e just  before the test needs them
* Tooling
  * In rails, we have "seeds" and "fixtures" built in
