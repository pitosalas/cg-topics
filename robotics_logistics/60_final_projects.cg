:h2 Term Projects - Proposal Stage

* Each team submits a project proposal for their project: :topic_link :hw_119a_term_project_proposal
* During the final 4-5 weeks of the course, working on the project will be the *only homework* (almost)
* Given more than one person on the team, and the time, we have pretty high expectations for an interesting project
* Pito and the TAs will be constantly available for help and advice

:slide_title Schedule

* All deliverables are due on the last day of class, May 4, 2021
* We will also have a Zoom house/demo sometime that week as well

:h2 Deliverables for term project

1. Source code
1. Project Report
1. Video demonstration
1. Contributions to Lab Notebook

**Note:** Your source code, project report, and video demonstration will be in a ROS package in a single repository that you will create in (or move to) the [Campus Rover GitHub organization](https://github.com/campusrover) and your lab contributions should be put in the [campusrover/labnotebook repo in the FAQ section](https://campus-rover.gitbook.io/lab-notebook/faq)

:slide_title Source Code

* High quality code, organized as ROS packages
* Adhering to reasonable professional design, structure, documentation as outlined in :topic_link :programming_style
* Including a readme.md. Use [How to write a quality readme](https://dev.to/coderarchive/writing-a-high-quality-readme-1k3j) as a guide.
* It should be organized and not have any random left over files
* It should be presentable as an interview artifact
  
:slide_title Project Report

* As a set of web pages, created with [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com) (a.k.a `gh-pages`)
    * `gh-pages` are a GitHub feature `to create a set of static web pages directly attached to your GitHub repo
    * Use `gh-pages` to create your project report
    * As a guide, if the web pages were printed out as a pdf it would be between 5 and 15 pages

* The report should include:

1. Introduction
    1. Problem statement, including original objectives
    1. Relevant literature
1. What was created (**biggest section**)
    1. Technical descriptions, illustrations
    1. Discussion of interesting algorithms, modules, techniques
    1. Problems that were solved, pivots that had to be taken
1. Reflection of the project. 
    1. How it unfolded, how the team worked together
    1. Reflection on the project and working as a team

:slide_title Video demonstration

* 4 to 8 minutes in length
* The quality should be comparable to if you were doing a live demo for, say, Tim Hickey
* Better than Pito's home movies, but not as good as Bong Joon-ho
* Show off your results, and explain and/or show the interesting computer science and engineering aspects


:slide_title Contribution to Lab Notebook

* Each student should make one Notebook contributions.
* Think about a how-to, tutorial, explanation, concept, that you had to figure out yourselves that was difficult to track down and write it up for the next generation of students
* Here are some examples: [Communicating with Rosserial](https://campus-rover.gitbook.io/lab-notebook/ros-tips/communicate-with-rosserial), [AWS RoboMaker](https://campus-rover.gitbook.io/lab-notebook/miscellaneous/aws-robomaker), [Alexa Voice Integration](https://campus-rover.gitbook.io/lab-notebook/cr-package/voice/voice)
