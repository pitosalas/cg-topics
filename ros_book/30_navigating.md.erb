desc: How does the robot get from here to there, iven a map and AMCL localization

#### Navigation

* Continuing from where we left off
* We have created a map using slam
* How do we use it for navigation?

#### SLAM
* Simultanuous Localiation and Mapping
* We will localize the robot on a map that is incomplete
* When it leaves the map it is able to extend it with the same algorithm

#### Reconstruct where we left off

<%= callout("NB", " Be careful with the filenames of the map. You will get strange errors if the file name given to turtlebot3_navigation is incorrect or not resolvable!") %>

<%= code_begin %>
# create the simulated environment called stage_4
$ roslaunch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_stage_4.launch

# launch a simulated turtlebot3 that drives a random pattern
$ roslaunch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_simulation.launch

# launch the slam algoritm, which will create an in-memory map data structure
$ roslaunch turtlebot3_slam turtlebot3_slam.launch slam_methods:=gmapping

# After the map looks done, save it into a map file for later.
$ cd ~
$ rosrun map_server map_saver -f stage4
<%= code_end %>

#### Navigating

##### Demo

<%= code_begin %>
# Now, close all the exiting ROS nodes down and next run this. Be careful with the
# file names because the yaml file contains a file name too and it is easy to 
# get things misaligned. 
# <filemname> will be something like /home/youraccount/stage4.yaml but check to make sure.

$ roslaunch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_stage4.launch
$ roslaunch turtlebot3_navigation turtlebot3_navigation.launch map_file:=<filename>

<%= code_end %>

* Give the robot an estimated position
* Give the robot a navigation goal by clicking the button in rviz
* Play around and see the robot solve the simple maze navigation including places it can't 'see' from where it is

##### Explanation

* The ROS **nav stack** is another complex bit of computer science, mathematics, and engineering
* For now we are going to just scratch the surface
* Inputs are a map, an estimated current position, scanner inforamtion, and a destination
* Behavior is to generate a path and steer the robot to it
* Avoiding obstacles
* Roughly:
    1. *navigation goal* is sent to the **nav stack**. This is done with an action call with a goal of *MoveBaseGoal* which specifies a target pose and a coordinate frame (called the *map* frame.)
    1. Nav stack uses a path-planning algorithm in the *global plannner* to create shortest path route
    1. Local planner drives along that path, while using sensor information to aboid obstacles.
    1. When the robot arrives at the goal pose the action terminates.
* Lets try it!


##### AMCL 

* Uncheck everything except RobotModel, Map and ParticleCloud in rViz.
* The green arrows are the pose estimates from `amcl`
* Tell `amcl` that the robot is somewhere else, and you see it do its best on guessing the pose
* Do this with the *2d pose estimate* command
* Turn on the Lasert Scan display
* Play with the *2d pose estimate* command and observe how the map becomes aligned

##### Behind the scenes

* amcl subscribes to a topic `geometry_msgs/PoseWith`
* rviz command *2d pose estimate* publishes the new proposed pose on that topic
* When amcl receives that message it resets its collection of candidate poses

##### Going inside the Nav Stack

* Global planner: works out best path assuming map is accurate
    **global costmap**: How safe or unsafe is each spot on the map
    * Published on /move_base/global_costmap/costmap
    * Planner view shows what the planned path to the nav goal is
* Local Planner: 
    * Adjusts the global plan based on newly detected obstacles
    * Map shows square area around robot with further analysis
    * Color shows safe areas in cold colors (like blue) and dangerous areas in warm colors (like red)

##### Navigating in code

* Look at [patrol.py](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/campusrover/rosbook/master/scripts/patrol.py)
* It is a `SimpleActionClient` which sends a repeating sequence of two Action Goals to `move_base`
* There's nothing tricky about itself.
* The challenge might be getting all the other bits set up so that it will work correctly

#### Summary
* How robots move around the world
* Building maps
* Using maps
* `move_base` takes action goals to move to somewhere else
* Importance of coordinate systems
