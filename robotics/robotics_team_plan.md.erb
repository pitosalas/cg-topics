title: Team Plan

#### Team Plan
This is a document that sets goals, deliverables and milestones. It is a kick off document so it can't be 100% accurate.
I do expect it to reflect a whole lever deeper of thinking about your stated project. I expect that you as a team will have to discuss, brainstorm, google in your further investigation of what your team would like to tackle. It should be 1-2 pages and not with a lot of filler.

You might cover:

* High level goal for your project
* Bits of technology that you need to learn or investigate (ROS and others)
* Subgoals for the project
* Prospective list of deliverables
* What do you as a team feel you must accomplish to be proud of the outcome
* Academic papers that look highly relevant and you want to study and investigate
* Modules of code that it looks like you will have to write
* How you think you can divide the work across the three members
