title: Implement and test the validation API
---

##### Purpose of this assignment

* Practice essential skills for your success in this course and in this field
  * Building an API for an existing service
  * Design a repeatable algorithm for validating the correct operation of your service
  * How to run a scalability test while validating correctness

##### API specification

<%= include_topic :nt_validation_api %>

##### Key References
* Here's the description of the whole <%= link_to_topic :nt_test_interface %>
* Here's the description of the <%= link_to_topic :nt_scalability_testing_protocol %>


##### Assignment

* Write the code to support this new api
* Run a major loader.io test on your backend
* While it is running, issue a request to this validation api from your laptop
* Note the output

##### Deliverables

* Source code for your just the implementation of the required code zipped. (In other words just one or two source files.)
* Explanation of how the code will validate the correct behavior of the backend
* Log of the result of making the call to the api on your laptop

##### Comments, Context and Hints

* It is very easy to introduce bugs as you optimize your system to scale to large numbers
* Bugs that cause exceptions are easy to catch, they will show up in your logs
* Bugs that lead to incorrect results are more difficult to sense
* Types of bugs:
  * Some tweets of a followed user don't show up on the follower's timeline
  * Some tweets show up on the wrong other users timeline
  * Some tweets are lost altogether, e.g. they went into the cache but not the database
  * And more of similar types
