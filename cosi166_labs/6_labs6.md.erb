due: March 12th, 2021

:h2 Welcome to Lab for March 12 2021

1. Work individually on both part 1 and part 2
1. TAs will be around to come over and help if you get stuck

:h2 Part 1 - Implement Simple Authentication (1 hour)

* There are lots and lots of tutorials on authentication
* You are required to do this implementation just as the tutorial says, and not use gems like `devise` or others
* The reason is that it will really cement for you how authentication works in rails but really in general
* Follow the following tutorial by coding it up step by step: [Building a Simple Session Based Authentication using Ruby on Rails](https://hackernoon.com/building-a-simple-session-based-authentication-using-ruby-on-rails-9tah3y4j)
* Ask for help if you get stuck and see if you can do it all in one hour!

:h2 Part 2 - Git and Github and the Command Line (1 hour)

* We will do an interactive, participative session
* Some of you will know this stuff cold and for you it will be a refresher
* Others will know it but have some key and crucial gaps
