* Practice Paper Prototyping and developing a user experience flow chart. Read: [Paper Prototyping](http://alistapart.com/article/paperprototyping), [7 Myths about Paper Prototyping](http://www.userfocus.co.uk/articles/paperprototyping.html), [How to create a UX flow chart](http://www.startuprocket.com/blog/how-to-create-a-user-experience-flow-chart-ux-flow-chart). Meet with your team to discuss your product further. Think about the product you are building and how it might look. Now, With your team, develop a set of single screen paper prototypes connected by arrows that indicate when a user action or event leas to another screen or page. I refer to this as your application process flow. Focus more on the connections between the screens than making super detailed screens. Use separate sheets of paper/images, one for each screen with indications of how you get to another screen. I discourage you from using html or other tools because you are always better off doing a sketch on paper before going to any tools. <%= team_deliverable "Submit one or more legible images. Seriously, no chicken scratches in pencil. They don't have to be artistic, but they have to be clear. Be prepared to share them in class." %>
