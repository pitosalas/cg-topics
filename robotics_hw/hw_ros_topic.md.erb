## Objective
* Ensure a correct installation of ROS on your computer
* Demonstrate understanding of topics, messages, publishing and subscribing

## Instructions
* Write an interesting demonstration of ROS
* Probably will be 2 or 3 short python programs
* It will not require a simulator nor a robot
* I recommend using one of the examples in either book or one of the oodles of ROS tutorials as inspiration.
* Be ready to demonstrate it in class

## Deliverable
* Zipped folder containing the python source code. Nicely formatted and appropriately commented and including a README
