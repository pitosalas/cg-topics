:h4 Key Take Aways from Chapter 5 - Leap

* Startups transform a vision into a product. Process involves doing experiments to get quantitative info and also qualitative.
* Build-Measure-Feedback loop, Goals is to go through the loop as fast as possible 
* Leap of faith Assumptions: the riskiest assumptions or hypotheses. If they are not true the startup may fail. 
* Two that always exist, and morph are: the value hypothesis and the growth hypothesis 
* Terms introduced: Innovation Accounting, Learning Milestones, Pivot, Metrics and vanity metrics 
* FB: They had metrics early on that 'proved' the valueâ€¦ How long users stayed on the site, how often they came back the next day, growth rate inside of individual college campuses 
* Assumptions vs. Hypotheses. They need to be tested quantitatively 
* Importance of careful analysis of what your hypotheses are cause they are often hidden 
* Some assumptions don't need to be tested because they are self-evident from existing experience. ('We know that people are willing to listen to music over earphones in public places.') 
* 'Value creating' is a better concept than 'Profitable' because it applies equally to non profits. 
* Innovation account is different from regular accounting because it helps measure the speed of cycling through the build measure learn cycle. Initially in a startup we don't know enough yet to set up innovation accounting. 
* Genchi Gembutsu: From Toyota Way - 'go see for yourself' - or - 'get out of the building' 
* Customer Archetype / Personas. Important to describe the customer, but remember that this too is a hypothesis! 
* Just-do-it vs. Analysis Paralysis. Too little or too much reliance on gathering data.
