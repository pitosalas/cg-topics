### catkin

* catkin is the ROS build system
* It's quite complicated and related to CMAKE
* Treat it like a black box

<slide_break></slide_break>

### Workspaces

* A subdirectory in which you will be doing your ROS work
* You need only one and it will be called catkin_ws/
* You should already have it on your linux install, but here's how you would create it otherwise:

<%= source_begin "language-bash" %>$ mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src
$ cs
$ catkin_init_workspace
<%= source_end %>

* From time to time you have to build things, called "doing a build or make"
* Use the alias `cm`

<slide_break></slide_break>

### .bashrc

* A "hidden" file in your home directory
* Contains a series of shell commands that are executed each time you start a shell
* It is `populated` with lots of useful stuff by the installation of ROS
* Any commands you want run each time will be placed there
* source `~/.bashrc command` reads the file and executes it as if you typed it into bash
* Key environment variables have to be defined in .bashrc

<slide_break></slide_break>

### example

<%= source_begin "language-bash" %>$ source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
$ export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://localhost:11311
$ export ROS_HOSTNAME=localhost
$ export TB3_MODEL=burger
$ export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=burger
<%= source_end %>

<slide_break></slide_break>

### ROS Packages

* A complete "application" or "tool", stored as a directory tree in a standard layout
* Analogous to a gem in ruby, or a library in Java
* Can be created like this:

<%= source_begin "language-bash" %>$ cd catkin_ws/src
$ catkin_create_pkg my_new_package rospy
<%= source_end %>

<slide_break></slide_break>

### Contents of a package directory

* `package.xml` # describes all the things that are in the package
* `CMakeLists.txt` # describes how to "build" 
* `./messages` # descriptors of the messages
* `./scripts` # contains all the python source files
* `./launch` # contains all the .launch files

<slide_break></slide_break>

#### Python programs

* Most of your python code will implement nodes
* You should put them into the ./scripts directory
* Name them *.py and give them execution file property: `chmod +x myfile.py`

<slide_break></slide_break>

### rosrun and roslaunch

<%= source_begin "language-bash" %>$cd catkin_ws

# run a certain program from a certain package
$ rosrun package program.py

# "execute" that launch file
$ roslaunch package file.launch 

<%= source_end %>

<slide_break></slide_break>

## Names, Namespaces and Remapping

* Everything in the ros world has a name that looks like a file path
* For example: `/cmd_vel` is a topic name
* To allow flexibility,m you can remap a name to another name on the command line, e.g.

<%= source_begin "language-bash" %>$ cs
$ ./image_view image:=right/image
<%= source_end %>

<slide_break></slide_break>

## roslaunch

* Many real ROS applications have multiple nodes
* To save time having to start each one separately
* (And for many other reasons)
* A .launch file contains instructions on what to launch and in what order
* You run it with the `roslaunch` command. It will start `roscore` if necessary
 
<slide_break></slide_break>

## tf: Coordinate Transforms
* See [TF Tutorial](http://wiki.ros.org/navigation/Tutorials/RobotSetup/TF)
* Coordinate system
* There will/can be many
* Some of the components might move (an arm for example)
* tf system periodically broadcasts the current relationship between coordinate systems
* Quaternions

<slide_break></slide_break>

### Poses, Positions, and Orientations

* Handy and very common term to mean: 3d position and 3d orientation of something
* (Not velocity, just the position)
* Usually the transform between the robot coordinate frame and the maps coordinate frame

<slide_break></slide_break>

### tf
* Frames: Essential and complicated concept
* Find the change in position and orientation between two coordinate frames
* High level: a way to compute relative coordinate systems
* `tf` is a central package of ROS which computes transformations for Frames
* If I know a position relative to the room, what is that position relative to the robot?
