title: Grading Components
---
* **Class Participation: ~25%:** Participation consists of attendance, in-class particiption, engagement with non-graded work. Attendance is required. We will be taking attendance.

* **Team Contribution (based on peer and self assessments) ~15%:** A major aspect of this course is your work on your team. Do you contribute personally to your team? Are you a positive influence on productivity? Are you a reliable team member? Do your team mates like working with you? Are you at the center of problems or of solutions? We will ascertain this based on personal observation, your TA partner comments, and peer and self assessments.

* **Individual Assignments: ~25%:** I will pay attention to whether you are just regurgitating the reading or really engaging with it. So, give a personal perspective or insight, make connections with other readings, your other classes, your own reading and research. Pay attention to writing good, professional English. Use the tools. Many students find that they benefit from using the Brandeis Writing Center to review first drafts.

* **Final Term Project: ~35%**: How well are the Lean Startup principles understood, documented and applied? Is the result based truly on hypotheses that are tested, getting out of the building, iterating, and getting true and challenging validations? How much did team members engage in the project? How compelling is the final case? Is it based on real evidence? Does the team explain and persuade in their presentation? Am I convinced that this is a real business that will make money and grow? How interesting is the product? What is the quality of writing, organization, clarity, fit and finish of a the final deliverables?
