title: "Sinatra Series 2: A Basic Service"

:h2 Purpose

This assignment will familiarize you with the basic mechanics of creating a Sinatra application. By going beyond reading to actually writing working code you will further cement your understanding.

:h3 Features that you will be creating 

* A Web service to access a database
* A REST API
* A Test Suite, TDD
* Sinatra + ActiveRecord

:h3 Initial API Spec

* `GET /api/users/paul` => JSON result
* Properly withhold password
* Properly return key information

:h2 Do this

* Look at :topic_link sinatra_series_api_test_tut
* Test is for a set of specific API calls, not of the database or other internals of the service
* And before the test runs, it creates a `test fixture` the particular user being looked up
* For the test to run there has to be a database (ActiveRecord) which is not yet set up

:h3 Database

* Make sure you have rake installed: `gem install rake`
* Create a migration `rake db:create_migration NAME=create_users`
* Add to the name, password, email and bio fields to the migration
* `rake db:create`
* Create the corresponding ActiveRecord model in model/user.rb
* Create database and migrate, both development and test databases!

:h3 Implement GET

* `get '/api/users/:name' do`
* Retrieve the parameter `:name` with `params[:name]`
* Use normal `activerecord` features to retrieve database
* Use `.to_json` to convert result to json
* Use .slice to make sure that the `password` field is not returned

:h3 Extend TDD tests

* Check that email, bio are also returned
* Check that password is NOT returned
* Add code to the User model so that password is not returned
* And tests now pass
 
:h3 Continue to implement, as follows:

* Implement test cases (TDD), demonstrate that they fail
* Implement the new APIs
* Demonstrate the test cases succeed
* Demonstrate operation of the server using an API testing client
  * Mac: Insomnia
  * Chrome: Advanced Rest Client
  * Many many others!

:h3 Additional APIs

* `POST /api/users`
  * Supply HTTP attributes: name, email, password and bio
  * Create a new user
  * Return the right status code.

* `DELETE /api/users/:name`
  * Delete user with name :name
  * When user with valid :name, then return status OK
  * When user with invalid :name, then return status 404

* `PUT /api/users/:id`
    * Supply parameters name, email, password and bio (one or more of them)
    * Return OK or 404 depending on whether the id is valid
    * Update the stated parameters
    * In the test case, verify that the update actually occurred.

* `POST /api/users/:name/validate`
  * Validate that a certain user's credentials are correct
  * Supply parameter: :password (clear text)
  * When supplied password is the password for user :name
    * Returns status OK
    * And name, email, bio and password of said user
  * When not, returns status 404

:h3 Submit this

* Respond to the following warmup questions:
    * Give an example that is not mentioned in the reading of a one to many relationship. Why is it one to many?
    * Explain what a foreign key is and how it is used, exactly, to do a one to many relationship.
    * In what way is a relational database similar or reminiscent of a spreadsheet?
    * Please list two concepts from the reading that you don't understand, and if you feel you understand it well, then the two most important ideas of this reading.
