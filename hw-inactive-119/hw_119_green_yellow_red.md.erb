## ROS Basics Homework
* This is an extension of a project in PRR Chapter 7

### What to do
* On your own computers, install TB3 software
* In ~/catkin_ws/src git clone prrexamples: https://github.com/campusrover/prrexamples
* Individually, in the emulator, run red_light_green_light.py and wander.py
* Read the code and make sure you understand both apps
* Try running them on a real robot
* Prepare to demo next Tuesday
* Modify red_light_green_light to do something new:
  * It cycles through Red (3 seconds),  Yellow (3 seconds), Green (3 seconds)
  * On Red it stops
  * On Green it goes forward at 0.22 Meters/second for 
  * On Yellow it rotates around the z-axis (turns) at 0.1 degree/second


### Deliverables
* Explain in your own words what red_light_green_light and wander do. Be precise
* The code of your modified red_light_green_light
* A short video of your screen demonstrating your modified program runninb in the emulator.
