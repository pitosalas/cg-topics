:slide_bigtitle Measuring effect of changes

* The crux of pivoting is having metrics on which to base the decision
* These are not arbitrary or generic
* They are specific to your product or service
* And they will figure directly into your eventual business model

:slide_title Try it yourself

* Discuss the crucial stages in user's experience with your product 
or service
* Look at the AARRR metrics. You may tweak them as appropriate for your project.
* The key to look for is whether you can collect metrics of the number of people at a stage
* An imaginary business?

:slide_title Break into teams

* Discuss what your stages would be 
:slide_title Why do we care about the Stages?

* Metrics and actionable metrics
* You also need a way to measure how many people make it to each step
* Without metrics your pivots are a shot in the dark
* Once you have a baseline
* Do the pivot
* Quickly determine if you improved where you expected to improved

:slide_title Pivots before the product can be tested and measured

* If key hypotheses prove incorrect, consider pivoting
* How is a pivot different from any other change?
* It's when something basic about the product itself is changed
* When a hypothesis fails to pan out, it might not change something essential
* The "cheaper" (quicker) you recognize the weakness of your approach the better
* It's a balance between creatively responding to the feedback ... or deciding that it's time to pivot
