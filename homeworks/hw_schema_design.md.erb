title: Schema Design Exercises
---
#### Introduction
This exercise lets you practice how to design a database. You've been introduced to this in preceding homeworks and classes, and this homework is a chance to rehearse the techniques of data modeling again.

To review some of the material take a look at:

  * [The basics of good database design in web development](http://www.onextrapixel.com/2011/03/17/the-basics-of-good-database-design-in-web-development/)
  * <%= link_to_topic :data_modeling %>
  * <%= link_to_topic :ar_db_mechanics %>

#### Notation
* Use this notation for this work.
* It contains exactly the same information that you've presented before, but in all text
* It is designed to correspond more closely to what you will be doing in your code
* Notation "syntax"
  * **table** `name` - the name of the individual relational table
  * `attribute_name`: **datatype** - an individual column of a table
  * `table1` **has_many** `table2` - One to many relationship
  * `table3` **belongs_to** `table4` - Many to one relationship
  * `table4` **has_many**: `table5` through: `table6`
* You should include all tables, including bridging and regularuar

##### Example
^
    table students
      id: integer
      first_name: text
      last_name: text
      dob: date
      department_id: integer

    table departments
      id: integer
      name: text
      budget: float

    table concentrations
      id: integer
      department_id: integer
      student_id: integer
      type: string ("major", "minor" or "program")

    students
      has_many concentrations
      has_many departments through concentrations

    concentrations
      has_one student
      has_one department

    departments
      has_many concentrations
      has_many students through concentrations
