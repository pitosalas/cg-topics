title: "Fiducials and Fiducial Slam"
desc: Demonstrate undertanding of Fiducials by implementing fiducial Slam
---
Fiducial Slam is a new package which combines uses fiducials rather than Lidar or Video to create a map. This map is going to be quite different in that it does not  show walls. It defines a coordinate space based on the location of multiple fiducials. It will not **contruct** a map but **locate** a map that was constructed in some other way and locate the robot as well within that space.
