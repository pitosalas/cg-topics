title: Haptic Feedback
desc: Using a haptic input device to get precise control with feedback

There are relatively inexpensive haptic input devices. Is it possible to write a tool which allows me to control the robot and get haptic feedback while doing so? What would it mean to do so? What would it be useful for?
