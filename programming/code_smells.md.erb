####Code Smells

* What are they?
  * Signs that your code can be made better
  * Things you should look for when doing a code review
  * Learned from practical experience
  * There are many lists, this is mine of the top ones
  * They are not hard-and fast
* The smells
  * Large class: Class longer than 100 or so lines
  * Large method: Method longer than 10 lines or so
  * Long parameter list: methods with 4 or more parameters
  * Single Responsiblity Violations: Class should do one thing
  * Global variables: Almost always a very bad sign
  * Bad Name: Non descriptive or very short variable names
  * Unnecessary complexity: Nested conditionals (ifs and case) are questionable
  * Feature envy: A class that uses methods of another class exessively
