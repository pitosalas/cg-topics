## MiniRover Student Purchase Program

### Not a requirement!

* Having your own MiniRover not required but it does add an extra level of fun to the course!
* You will be able to learn a lot and get a great grade without having your own robot
* Still getting your hands dirty with a physical robot adds a lot to the experience

### Purchase and Assembly

* We have arranged some discounts on some of these
* With discounts the total is $290
* We have arranged to have the robots assembled and tested for free
* For pickup in Waltham after payment
* If you want you can also do it all yourself

### Process

1. Send a check to Brandeis. It is *ULTRA IMPORTANT* that you include the MS018 and the memo as indicated. 

        Amt: $290
        To: Brandeis University
        Memo: GoPiGo3 Robot, c/o Pito Salas
        
        Mail to:
        Brandeis University 
        415 South St, MS018
        Waltham, MA 02453

1. Send an email to Pito saying `Pito, I confirm that I will be sending a check for $270 to receive a MiniRover Robot` Once I receive this email I will order the robot ahead of actually receiving your check.

* Arrange a time and place to pick up the robot
* If you want we will "buy back" the robots at a discount
* The buy back will be $175 or less or a lot less or not at all
* Depending on the condition
