title: "12: Follow Bot"
desc: "Adding perception to our robot algorithms"

#### Introduction
* How can the robot follow lines on the ground?
    * Acquire images
    * Filter the images
    * Steer the robot

#### Acquiring Images
* Message: `sensor_msgs/Image`
* Run Gazebo to simulate a robot with a camera
* Since the TB3 Waffle has a camera, we will use those models, and then run gazebo

<%= code_begin %>
$ export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL="waffle"
$ export TB3_MODEL="waffle"
$ roslaunch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_world.launch
$ rostopic list | grep /camera
<%= code_end %>

* Note all the camera related topics being published
* The image itself can be found upder `/camera/rgb/image_raw`
* `../compressed` is good for sending the images over wifi
* `../theora` applies even more compression

##### Look at image

* Lets visualize the image
* Choose from each of the topics relating to the camera
* Move the robot in Gazebo and watch the picture change

<%= code_begin %>
$ rqt_image_view
<%= code_end %>

##### Run the simplest program

* `$ /follower.py`
* We can see the new  node subscibing to the topic:

<%= code_begin %>
$ rosrun
$ rosnode info follower
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Node [/follower]
Publications: 
 * /rosout [rosgraph_msgs/Log]

Subscriptions: 
 * /camera/rgb/image_raw [sensor_msgs/Image]
 * /clock [rosgraph_msgs/Clock]

Services: 
 * /follower/get_loggers
 * /follower/set_logger_level


contacting node http://10.0.0.95:39103/ ...
Pid: 17179
Connections:
 * topic: /rosout
    * to: /rosout
    * direction: outbound
    * transport: TCPROS
 * topic: /clock
    * to: /gazebo (http://10.0.0.95:42857/)
    * direction: inbound
    * transport: TCPROS
 * topic: /camera/rgb/image_raw
    * to: /gazebo (http://10.0.0.95:42857/)
    * direction: inbound
    * transport: TCPROS

<%= code_end %>
* First section is information determined from roscore about what /follower is doing
* Second section is information directly from the /follower node about it's connections
    * We see that it is publishing to /rosout
    * And is subscribed to /clock (from gazebo)
    * And /camera/rgb/image_raw (from gazebo too)
* Lets find out the frame rate (simulated by gazebo)
<%= code_begin %>
rostopic hz /camera/rgb/image_raw
subscribed to [/camera/rgb/image_raw]
WARNING: may be using simulated time
average rate: 10.204
	min: 0.019s max: 0.131s std dev: 0.03037s window: 10
<%= code_end %>
* So, we are receiving about 10 images per second
* Which is why my computer is so slow :)

#### Race Course
<%= callout("NB", " We diverge from the book a little. Note different roslaunch") %>

* Load a new world into gazebo
<%= code_begin %>
roslaunch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_autorace.launch
<%= code_end %>

* You will see in gazebo, a TB3 Waffle on a little racetrack
* Here's the track, and the view from the camera:

<%= include_image "/content/topics/images/follow_camera.png" %>
<%= include_image "/content/topics/images/follow_track.png" %>

* Our goal is to detect the line using OpenCV, so we can then actually follow it
* Technique will be simplistic: filter a block of rows by image color and drive the robot towards the center of the pixels that pass the filte
* Note that this will fail in many normal cases!
