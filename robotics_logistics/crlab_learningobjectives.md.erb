##### Learning Objectives

The purpose of this course is to improve students’ understanding of the computer science and engineering of robotics, getting exposure to some of the big ideas, algorithms and structures that come into play. Students will work in small teams and with little guidance to investigate how to address certain challenges, and be highly self-sufficient and motivated to drive projects to their conclusion.

#### Students will

* **ROS:** Learn to program the all-important “Robot Operating System”, ROS, which is the leading real-time distributed operating system for research and industrial robotics. They will demonstrate understanding of the key concepts of ROS, nodes, topics, commands and services, concurrency, distributed operating systems, and more.

* **Robotics:** Learn the software architecture and fundamental algorithms of Robotics: localization, mapping, SLAM, AMCL, frames, path planning, state management and much more.

* **Architecture:** Learn how to think architecturally within the context of a fully distriuted operating system. How to create small concurrent modules that communicate with each other. How to organize desired functionality and behavior for maximum flexibility and scalability within such an environment.

* **Teams**: In our small classes, there is a lively discussion among students trying to build new behaviors into the robots. Students will demonstrate effective working in teams, collaborating, sharing responsibilities, taking on both fun and less fun projects if they are required.

* **Agile**: Work in a modified scrum model, using Kanban to manage stories, having standup meetings and doing demos of work every single week. They will learn and demonstrate professional and agile software entgineering processes, including writing elegant, readable, documented code, working in rapid iterations.
