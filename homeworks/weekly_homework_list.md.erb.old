title: Weekly Homework List
---
## From Last Year. This year we do it differently.

* Homeworks are due on Monday night unless I announce an exception
* There is an automatic 3 day grace period with 20 points deduction
* If you don't follow the required format, that is another 20 point deduction
* Participation homeworks are always submitted to the [participation blog](https://moodle2.brandeis.edu/mod/forum/view.php?id=1134492)
