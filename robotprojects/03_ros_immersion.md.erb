title: "Project: ROS Immersion"
desc: Get to know the ROS with a small project
---
#### Intro
ROS is quite complicated to get up and running, and to really understand. This is a warmup project which will allow students to really get familiar with it in a hands-on manner.

#### Learning Objectives
* Install ROS on your computer and demonstrate operation
* Write a simple example program with ROS and run in simulator
* Understanding the role and purpose of nodes, topics, commands and services
* Understanding the key components and utilities: ROSCORE, ROSTOPICS
* Ability to write and run ROS Nodes
* Join the community

#### Deliverables
* A brief report in your lab notebook describing the results of each of the "Steps" below. Include a link to a video of your results to your lab notebook.

#### Steps to do

##### Part 1 - Setup

* Acquire and read the first 4 Chapters of [Programming Robots with ROS](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Robots-ROS-Practical-Introduction/dp/1449323898)
* Get Ubuntu ready and install ROS on your computer, FOLLOW EXACTLY [THESE INSTUCTIONS](http://turtlebot3.robotis.com/en/latest/introduction.html).
* Use gazebo simulator to view the robot in a simulated world.
* Use teleop to drive the robot around
* See what it does and try to record a video (<%= link_to_topic :screencast %>).
* Read especially Chapter 4 again  carefully.
* Watch and follow the recommended youtube tutorials in ROS concept.

##### Part 2 - First program

* First thing first: Sign up a ROS answer account. [Join the community.](http://answers.ros.org/questions/)
* Post a question! See what it's like to get help from the community!
* In part One, you learned about how to try around the simulated robot, in this part you are going to explore the idea of "Node".
* Write a node that subscribes the location(hint: use command rostopic list to see what you can subscribe) of the monitor and print out the result with ROS_INFO.

##### Part 3 - Random walk

* With the code you write before. Now try to publish a message.
* Publish twist messages to make the robot walk randomly.
*  Write and get to run the WanderBot example from the book

##### Part 4 - Something more complicated
* With the knowledge of Subscriber and Publisher, write your version of teleop.
* Advanced: make a gui teleop. You can start from here: https://github.com/rozoalex/ROS_NavigationControlPanel/blob/master/scripts/location_monitor_node.py
* Run the similators and move the TB3 with teleop
* Write a ROS program to have the robot drive around one of the obstacles in the simulator
