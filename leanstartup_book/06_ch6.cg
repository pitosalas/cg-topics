:h3 MVPs for Testing

* MVP is designed to test a hypothesis. Not necessarily a prototype
* Visionaries or early adopters accept in fact expect a product that is incomplete. They want to be ahead
* Early adopters want to feel special: be the first one on the block with a product, or have an unfair advantage over other companies.
* Realize that if you leave out features, customer will often fill in the blanks in their mind giving you info about what feature to add or not.
* How can you test whether 10% of trial users will install, if you can't even get trial users?
* MVP: any work beyond whats needed to learn / prove the hypothesis is waste!
* Food on the Table: I thought it an odd idea: delivering customized recipes based on specials in the local grocery store. An extended scenario of an MVP is described. Lessons:
* Aardvark uses "wizard of oz testing" which to me sounds just like concierge!",
 
:slide_title MVP thoughts

* Is the MVP philosophy at odds with 'quality'?
* Customers donâ€™t care how difficult or costly it is to provide something; and the thing they love most might be very minor in your eyes",
* Role of courage: you need to dare to respond to what you learn even if it is not what you thought or intuited.",
* Commit to iterate",
* Even if the MVP fails decide up front that you will pivot and iterate
