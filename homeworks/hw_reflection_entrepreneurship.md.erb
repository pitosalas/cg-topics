title: Reflection on Entrepreneurship
---
**Reflection on Entrepreneurship**: I would like you to think back about what you thought about yourself as an entrepreneur before you took this course and how your views might have evolved. Write up a retrospective blog post thinking about questions such as: How do you feel you've changed your views on entrepreneurship and what it takes to be one? Do you see a role for yourself as an entrepreneur in the future? How has your thinking and approach about starting something brand new changed? What have you learned about yourself as an entrepreneur? How have you grown? In what way do you feel better prepared now? In what way have I clarified what I want to do when I graduate?
