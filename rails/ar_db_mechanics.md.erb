#### ActiveRecord DB Mechanics
* ActiveRecord
	* Library from Ruby on Rails which is the connection between the rails application and the underlying database
	* For advanced designs, there are options other than Activerecord
	* ActiveRecord is also often used by itself, especially in Sinatra
* Naming
	* Model.rb file is named singular, e.g. User
	* Corresponding db table is plural and lower case, e.g. users
* Correspondences
	* Each instance of the class (e.g. User) corresponds to a single record in the dabase
	* When a query returns a bunch of records, you get a collection of instances of the class
	* (this is classic Active Record model)
* Attributes
	* Rails will automagically create the methods to access each field of the record in the database
* Different database 'servers'
	* Sqllite - local database, no need for a server
	* MySql - Standard industrial strength database, free
	* Postgress - Becoming very popular with Rails community
* Migration [Rails Guide: Migrations](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/migrations.html)
	* rails generate model -h
	* rails generate migration -h
* Datatypes supported by Rails
