#### What makes a great Cosi166b Product

While we don't have a fixed rubric for what we consider to be an excellent Cosi166 Term project deliverable, here are some of the things we look at:

* This course is about Software Engineering, not business. You don't need to concern yourself at all with whether your product would sell well or make money. 

* The "Ruby on Rails Tutorial" gives a detailed example of a kind of a social network. Your product should not be simply another social network. In other words don't just take the code from the tutorial and do some renaming and reorganization.

* There are numerous ways to go beyond the Rails basics. We are looking for you to push the envelope in this way. We want your product to be interesting from a technology perspective.

* It should work. It should do what it is supposed to do? When I click on a button does it work? This is totally app dependent but in general this will come out in a demo. Are you showing you a lot or very little. Is there some real functionality? 

* You should be using good Software Engineering and design practices. Views and Controllers should not have much logic in them. You classes and methods should be relatively short, so refactor them if they exceed around 100 and 20 lines respectively.

* You should be following the Rails conventions and not bypass or circumvent the core rails components. However it shows good design if you have factored out some logic into a PORO (Plain Old Ruby Object) and place it in a app/lib directory (for example.)

* We look for you to follow professional software engineering practices. You should have some amount of automated testing built into your app so that the `rails test` command runs those tests. And then you should have set up including: automated testing amd continuous testing and deployment using CodeShip or some similar capability. And you should show that you are automatically deploying to Heroku only when tests pass.

* We don't expect your app to win design awards. But the user interface should be show pride in your craft. It should be professional and clean. The important features should be finable. The layout and graphic design should follow basic design rules of thumb.

##### Ways to go beyond the basics

I mentioned that you should go beyond the basics, beyond just implementing the Rails Tutorial with tables and coliumns renamed. These are in alphabetical order. You don't need all of these, obviously.

* Accessibility features
* Ajax for Lively, responsive web site
* Augmented reality feature
* Background processing of some kind
* Brandeis Authentication Integration
* Caching (Redis or other) to improve scalability
* Database Schema that is interesting or complicated 
* Docker Containers
* Google Maps integration
* GraphQL interface
* Machine Learning algorithms meaningfully tied to overall product
* Mobile app
* Mobile interface
* Push Processing
* REST API, especially if you also include a client to this
* RSS or iCal feed generation or subscription
* Service oriented architecture
* Voice + Speech
