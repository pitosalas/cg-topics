title: URL - Uniform Resource Locator
---
#### URL
* Everyone look at urls of different web sites and see what patterns you detect
* Discuss what people have found

##### Fundamental importance of the URI/URL
* URI = "Uniform Resource Identifier"
  * Used to be called "Universal Resource Locator" (URL)
  * Because the resources were files on the disk of the server
* And the URL's path was really a path!
* Focus now on the 'path' part of the URI
* e.g. some ugly examples
  * http://roomscheduler.com/reserve/room/3
  * http://bookstore/gonewiththewind/order/3
  * http://nyt.com/latest-updates?year=2014
* e.g. some good examples
  * http://roomscheduler.com/room/3/request
  * http://bookstore.com/book/412/price
  * http://tourmanager.com/city/boston/tour/tuesday/new
* There are many ways to structure a url

##### RESTful style of URI design
* "Representational State Transfer" (See [Original REST Paper](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm))
* Each URI denotes a specific 'resource'
  * 'room 3' or 'book 412' or 'tuesday tours IN Boston city'
  * It is usually not a file but something generated 'on the fly'
  * Still the same URI should yield the same resource every time (handwave)
* Each URI is used in combination with an HTTP "method"
  * Get: retrieve the indicated "resource"
  * Put: update value of the indicated resource
  * Delete: delete the indicated resource
  * Post: Create a new instance of indicated resource
  * (some other, less important ones)

##### One of the earliest design questions
* What do the URLs for my app look like?
* Conceptually, they are "directory structure-like" URLs
* There is a coherent "syntax" about them, e.g.
  * http://www.myservice.org/discussion/topics/{topic}
  * http://www.myservice.org/discussion/2008/12/10/{topic}
  * http://www.myservice.org/discussion/{year}/{day}/{month}/{topic}
