title: User Experience and Flow
---
* **Affordances**: An affordance is some characteristic of an object that communicates how it is to be operated.

  A keyhole in a lock tells me that I need a key and where to insert it. A handle on a fridge tells me how to pull it. A bottlecap on a bottle of beer tells me something. But does it tell me to use a bottle opener or just unscrew it?

  Read this paper: [Affordance, Conventions and Design](http://www.jnd.org/dn.mss/affordance_conv.html)

  With this context, look around your daily world (room, office, campus) for affordances everywere. Find and photograph **three** examples where (visible) affordances were absent, or communicated the wrong thing. *Be serious, not silly.* <%= deliverable "Post your photos to Latte with commentary." %>
* **Team**: Practice Paper Prototyping and developing a user experience flow chart.

  Once everyone has read the above articles and thought about them, try to apply what you read about. With your team, develop a set of single screen paper prototypes connected by arrows that indicate when a user action or event leas to another screen or page. I refer to this as your application process flow.

  Focus more on the connections between the screens than making super detailed screens. Use separate sheets of paper, one for each screen with indications of how you get to another screen. *I discourage you from using html or other tools because you are always better off doing a sketch on paper before going to any tools.*

  Spend 1-2 hours as a team, divide up the work and come up with a process flow for your app. You don't need to do more than 10 pages. Tape them to a whiteboard, draw the lines on the board.

  So what you will have is a series of paper prototypes of individual screens of your product, connected by lines showing what action in one screen would send you to the other screen. You get a network or user experience flow chart.

  *Whatever you decide to do, be neat and professional in your submission*

  <%= team_deliverable "Submit one or more images with the result of your work. You can use your smartphone to just take pictures. But make shure they are legible!!! Because we will look at them together in class." %>

#### Affordances
  * Why is the notion of affordinaces important?
  * Let's look at some of the pictures that you submitted

#### Creating an MVP / Prototyping / Mockups
* Reminder: <%= link_to_topic :mvp %>
* Compare terms: MVP vs. prototype vs. mockup
* You need to be able to articulate exactly why you are creating a prototype
* Looks like vs. Works like
* Purpose of prototype dictates the medium and fidelity

<%= include_topic :ux_basics %>

##### Making a User Experience flow diagram: P2P Tours
* Let's start with B2BTours, using this description:

<%= callout("pitch", " B2B Tours is a two sided market place, connecting individual tour guides with travelers seeking a tourguide. It increases access to great and novel tourguides, while opening up the market to those tourguides to a totally new set of clients.") %>

* Let's explore these questions:
  * What are the personas? How many are there?
  * If I am the end user whats the first thing I want to see?
  * What are the actions I need from that state?
  * Etc.
