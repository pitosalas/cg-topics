title: PRR Chapter 10 and PA assignment "Double Follow"
---
:h2 1. Read and do PRR Chapter 10 (part 1)  :partbadge

* Chapter 10 has a lot in it so I've divided it into two. For this part, remember to refer to this (<%= link_to_topic :prr_localization %> in parallel and use the code I provided!).
* There's not a lot of code to write, but I would like you to actually run all the examples and try to understand what is going on. With that, answer the following questions about TF2:
    1. Why is it important to get a good initial localization? Why is that needed at all? Could AMCL work without it?
    1. This one is a little tricky. When I am using AMCL and move_base, can I use teleop to cause the robot to crash into the wall. Give your reasoning! You might  need to try this to get a good answer. It will be a very interesting experiment.
    1. Please write one or two things that are still confusing to you; if it's all clear, then please write one or two major takeaways.
    1. <%= deliverable "Your responses to the above questions, in brief, in a pdf with your name and homework number at the top." %>

:h2 2. Read and do PRR Chapter 10 (part 2) :partbadge

* Chapter 10 has a lot in it so I've divided it into two. This is part 2 so remember to refer to this (<%= link_to_topic :prr_navigating %> in parallel and use the code I provided!).
* There's not a lot of code to write, but I would like you to actually run all the examples and try to understand what is going on. With that, answer the following questions:
    1. How does move_base use the map, if at all?
    1. Why is it necessary to give an "estimated position"?
    1. What does amcl do during navigation, and why is that necessary?
    1. Please write one or two things that are still confusing to you; if it's all clear, then please write one or two major takeaways.
    1. <%= deliverable "Your responses to the above questions, in brief, in a pdf with your name and homework number at the top." %>
