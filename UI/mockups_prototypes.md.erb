title: Mockups and Prototypes
---
## What's the difference between a mockup and a prototype?
* Note that hardware and software are very different in this context
* Mockup typically is static and non-functional
* Prototype typically is somewhat dynamic and somewhat functional
* But there is a definite grey area in between

### What's the purpose?
* It's a classic MVP testing one ore more hypotheses
* Therefore the amount of "fidelity" depends on what the hypotheses are
* Pick the approach that is the cheapest way to check those hypotheses
* Only create one when the cheaper or more important hypotheses have been tested

### (Software) Mockups and Prototypes, from cheap to expensive
1. Paper sketch
1. Paper prototype ([Paper Prototyping Helper Kit](http://www.userfocus.co.uk/resources/prototype.html)
)
1. Wireframing or general drawing tool ([Balsamiq](www.balsamiq.com), powerpoint, google drawings, etc.)
1. Image editing tools (Photoshop and similar)
1. Real HTML and javascript run in a browser
1. Live prototype (can be done with [Balsamiq](www.balsamiq.com)
1. Actual working code.
