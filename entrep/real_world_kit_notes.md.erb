* Everyone join LinkedIn right now while I wait
* Everyone connect to me, at least
* The personal network you start building now is more powerful than anything else I say

* Pito's patented networking technique
  * When you meet someone interesting, make effort to make a connection.
  * Get contact info.
  * Use spreadsheet (people, names, email, date of last convo, interest)
  * personal details as well - not just contact info, why and how you met them
  * Contact every 6 months.
  * Remind the person where they know you from.
  * Objective of conversation - have a purpose
  * Give them something of interest to them.
  * Assume that you have something interesting to say.

* Linkedin
  * easier to get in touch with people in specific areas (Connect with friends of friends)
  * Put updated information on Linkedin, which has ability to export a resume like PDF

## Resumes

* Who looks at Resumes
* How do they do it
* When does a resume turn into an interview
* Who does the next interview?

* Resume content
  * No need for permanent address
  * Leadership and Activities is good, but try and have a special qualifications section, put that at very top! Why is that special?
  * competitive advantage/ What makes you special? (professionally)
  * How will you benefit the Company?
  * Put details about activities/accomplishments, not just a title
  * add more detail about more important sections of resume
  * Have dates
  * People read resumes in "two seconds"; think of yourself as a product.
  * Put skills etc. in priority order (what you know best goes first)

  * It is an ongoing process
  * Education section not necessary espec. high school
  * Color is OK!
  * make sure black and white version of your colored resume looks just as good
  * Show, don't tell. Don't try and spend a whole page writing out your personality. You won't have any room for other things and it will be dificult to read
  * Career Objective
    * First sentence of resume state what you want from the job (Written in the frame of the reader)
    * Should be in cover letter as well
    * Make it consistent and relatively specific

  * Have a project that you released into the "real" world
  * Something you had a major role in (can say it is your work)

## Interviews / Phone screens

* Phone screens
  * Preparing
  * Doing well or not well during a screen
  * Skill Based
  * They might pick out parts of resume, more description and detail about what you did
  * Know background of the company
  * Gave a question or two ready about the company
  * Try to be positive about the company, even if you have doubts, at least until you get a job offer
  * Make sure they are relevant
  * Know everything on your resume; review older projects

* Interviews
  * How to dress and behave

    * when you have little to no technical experience in an internship you're interested in.
  * How to sell yourself
    * What if you're not confident in my past experiences.
    * When finding yourself out of your depth skill set wise, how can you emphasize your other strong qualities for a position?

* Classic Interview Gambits
  * Difficult questions
  * What salary do you want?
  * When can you start?

* Followups
  * Best way to follow up after a career fair or after a meeting: Follow up email
  * When to call to ask status
  * Short thank you - sneak in something about wanting to talk more
  * Send a link or potentially more information that came up in your conversation
  * If you don't have the interviewer's contact info, email it to the contact you have and ask them to forward it
  * Feel free to followup on your followup
  * After two emails, don't continue
  * Don't expect a response from just a resume or even a phone screen. There should be one from an interview
