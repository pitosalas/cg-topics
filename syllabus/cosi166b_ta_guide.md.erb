:h3 Our major goal is to give students a rewarding learning experience

* Be my Eyes and Ears - Help me know what's going on
* Consult and advise me on the course, content, homeworks etc.
* Remember that you can ask to step back if you are burned out
* Time Investment
* Academic Honesty

:slide_title Specific Duties

* Grading - Mostly "P" but others too
* TAs pair up with students
* TA partners with teams
* Slack engagement
* Office hours
* Lab attendance

:slide_title Your Rails Knowledge

* Quickly go through and "do" all the chapters of Ruby on Rails Tutorial (as I have been doing)

:h3 Grading

* Done in Gradescope (new this year)
* Promise the student that grades are posted 1 week after the deadline
* Rubrics will be in Gradescope. Let me know if they are missing.

:h3 TA Partnering

* Cheer leader
* Help in any way possible
* Tie breaker, conflict resolver
* Get to know the students on the team so they are really comfortable with you.
* Make sure that they schedule a weekly team meeting at a certain time and place (you don't need to attend)
* Meet regularly and report back about their status (in TA meeting)

:h3 Office Hours

* Zoom or in person, depending on demand and your own comfort level
* Each TA start with 1 OH per week, starting mid-september
* Coordinate your schedules and respond to demand

:h3 Slack

* Be on slack all the time and allow notifications
* As a group try to be responsive on slack

:h3 Lab

* One of you will have to be present at every lab
* I am considering making lab over zoom to avoid close contact
* I will provide a topic for each lab (at the beginning)

:h3 Team Formation

* TA team proposes teams based on surveys, class standing
* Teams are of 4 people. To deal with unevenness we can accept some teams of 5 or 3 but minimal
* Students will add and drop over the first four weeks and so we will be tweaking
* When making a change to a team, we want to be as least disruptive as possible
* Move only one or only two or ... the minimum number
* If you have to add or remove student, pay attention to who they or the other teammates wanted to work with.
