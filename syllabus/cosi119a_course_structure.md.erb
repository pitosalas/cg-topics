## Course Structure
This course is relativel unstructured. There are two weekly classroom meetings where you will learn the concepts and techniques of robotics. But you cant really learn robotics in a classroom! You will be spending much more time in the Autonomous Robotics Lab working with our actual robots developing and testing and experimenting! The course has two distinct phases:

### Week 1-5 - Learning and Doing with ROS
During the first 5 weeks you will what you need to know about ROS. ROS is a rich distributed operating system which is used both in research and commerce. We will learn it through reading, discussions and developing a variety of smaller Robotic aglorithms and programs

### Week 6-13 - Projects
During this second part of the course all students are oriented around addingn capabilities to the "Camous Rover" robot. Using Kanban, students form and reform small teams to work on interesting stories. The stories are written by the Product Owner, and generally are the result of brainstorming with students about what they think we should do next. The teams can be from 1 to 5 students, for 1-4 weeks, depending on the project.
