##### Add-Drop Policy
Every semester begins with what some people called a shopping period, when you can add and drop courses. Students use this to sample different courses and decide which ones they prefer. There are some important things you need to understand:

<%= callout("NB", " The course begins for real on the first day of class. Your peers and professors expect that you attend and participate in the class even if y ou are not sure yet whether you will take it.") %>

You are responsible for the material and the assignments starting on day one and you will be graded accordingly. Please don't ask for special treatment because you missed the first class or the first assignments. There are no makeups. Students who miss the first classes and/or assignment will likely have a lot of trouble as the class continues and likely will be less successful in this course.

If you decide that you will not take the course then please drop it immediately. This will allow other students on the waitlist to get in.
