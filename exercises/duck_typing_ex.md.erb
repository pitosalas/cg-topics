## Objective

### General case
Design a publish-subscribe facility. In this scenario there's a class that writes log records to a log file. Whenever an interesting event happens anywhere in the system, we want to easily cause a log entry to be written.

### Specific Scenario
We implement a PubSub processor that handles publishing and subscribing. Any class in the system who wants to find out that an event happened, can register as a subscriber. Any other class who wants to publish something to a subscriber can call publish_to_subscriber.

In the code below, we show a partial example, where a Event Logging class (Logger) needs to record interesting events in the log file. Specifically, to record each time an email is received. At the same time, a MailHandler class would like to get something into the log whenever an email is received.

### Your assignment
* Complete the class below, adding missing lines of code
* Write an additional class, MailBilling
  * With a method "process" which also subscribest to email messages
  * And displays text to the console: "Sending bill for message <subject>"

## Here's the sample code to start with
<%= ruby_begin %>
# Class contains all email processing
class MailHanndler
  def initialize(pubsub_handler)
    @pubsub = pubsub_handler
  end

  def generate_test_emails
    mail_received("Welcome to our system")
    mail_received("You are the winner")
    mail_received("Please applaud")
  end

  # Whenever a new email is received, the mail_received method is called.
  def mail_received(subject_line)
    @pubsub.publish_to_subscribers(:mail, subject_line)
  end
end

# Class manages writing events to event logs
class Logger
  def initialize
  end

  # clients call this method to add something to the log
  def process(log_message)
    puts "Log occurred: #{log_message}"
  end

end

# Class manages PubSub
class PubSub
  def initialize
    #...
    #...
  end

  # Subscribers can tell PubSub they are interested in certain events
  def register_subscriber(subscriber)
    #...
    #...
  end

  def publish_to_subscribers(parameter)
    #...
    #...
  end

end

# Hyper simplified code!

# Create a new PubSub handler
@ps = PubSub.new

# Create a new event logging system
@logger = Logger.new
@ps.register_subscriber(:mail, logger)

# Create a new mail handler and trigger three test emails
@mh = MailHandler.new(@ps)
@mh.generate_test_emails

<%= ruby_end %>
