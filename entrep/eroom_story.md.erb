#### The eRoom Story
* Story of eRoom's entry into the market
  * Pito and Jeffrey in 1995: Home delivery of groceries
  * The importance of domain expertise
* The case we made to the VC about our competitive advantage: Internet + Desktop software + groupware
* How to position it? Groupware, Collaboration, Teamware: all were dirty words
  * Customers (early adopters) really liked our value proposition
  * "We are constantly reinventing the wheel"
  * "there's too much email"
  * "we should be sharing better"
  * "we are inefficient"
* How to sell: Download vs. Corporate sales team
  * Direct sales: selling an alpha and beta test
  * At first it went well but then it didn't
* We needed to get more specific
  * Go beyond "nice to have" to "must have"
  * Vitamin vs. Aspirin
* What happened next
  * Horizontal/Vertical/Horizontical
  * The importance of real domain expertise
  * Why vertical (IMHO) is easier place to start
