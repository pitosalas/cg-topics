#### Usability Tests
* Don't guess!
	* "Get out of the buiidling"! It's so much easier to grab one or two or more real humans
	* Evidence from 2 or 3 random people is often enough, but really you don't need for than 5-10..
* Can be conducted at any stage
	* Paper prototype
	* Online mockup or 'wireframes'
	* Actual build
	* The difference is how hard/painful it is to make changes - which is inversely proportional to how open you will be listening
	* This could be testing a paper prototype 
	* early, when it is easy to make big modifications,
	* or later with actual software - when it's more difficult to make changes
* Preparation
	* Decide on a task(s) for user. "Log in and post a picture", "Check and update your privacy settings"
	* Decide on the type(s) of users.
	* Decide on what knowledge or assumptions they will start with (new user, experienced user, musician, programmer, etc.)
* Rules of thumb to follow
	* Try to get the 'victim' to narrate their thought process
	* Make sure they know that if they are confused, it is the fault of the software, not their fault
	* If and when they get stuck, engage them in a conversation by giving them small hints
	* Ask them for a suggestion on how it would be clearer, for example:
	* "Let's say you want a plain pizza and you see this screen, what would you do?"
	* "Oh you can't decide, well tell me, what are you looking for right now on the screen?"
* Running the test
	* Mistakes are ALWAYS the fault of the software not the user. Make sure they know this and don't feel like they have to appologize when things go wrong.
	* Don't help.
	* Ask them to narrate their thought process: "I am not looking for a button called security or privacy. Oh here's one called settings, maybe that's it. I am going to click it. Hm, I expected to find security related stuff here but instead I see..." etc.
* Make notes
	* Keep it simple
	* You don't need a one way mirror, video recording etc etc.
	* You don't need 10 subjects. Usually after 2-3 you already know what the problems are
	* ACT ON WHAT YOU LEARN!
