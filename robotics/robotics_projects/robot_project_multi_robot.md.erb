title: Multi Robot Discovery
desc: Design a system that would allow the control of multiple robots
---
In the standard configuration, we run roscore on the robot itself which means that only one robot can be accessing ROS at a time. What if we had multiple robots?

* After investigating the literature and available libraries
* Design a scenario with 5 robots that are all working together
* At the least you need to overcome the roscore restriction
* But then you also need the robots to know where each one is

* What if they are within sight of each other
* What if they cannot see each other
* What if an unknown robot appears

* Can they do something together?
* Choreographed
* Perhaps they all follow a leader in a convoy
* The leader is teleop controlled
* The others follow
