title: Scaling by Caching

###  Scalability Pattern: General Caching

#### Overview of caching

* Save the result of a request with a given set of parameters.
* In a future request with the same parameter (maybe) return the same result
* System level caching. Storage:
  * In 'local' memory
  * In 'remote' memory
  * In database
  * In Cloud
* Awareness of order of magnitude speed of operations:
  * Access registers inside CPU
  * Access CPU caches
  * Access standard RAM
  * Access local disk
    * Access files
    * Access local database
  * Access over network
    * To a nearby server
    * To a nearby database server
  * Access over the internet
    * To a remote server
    * To a remote database server
    * To a remote Web Service

* Memoization:
  * caching applied to an individual method
  * A basic programming technique
  * Simple
* Name-value databases
  * Very fast searches and lookups
  * Distributed searches and distributed databases
  * Robust across system and application failures
* Database Caching
  * To a certaine extent, it's what databases do
  * Caching both at the server (postgres itself)
  * And at the client (the postgres and activerecord subsystems)
  * Yet a lot more can be done
* Server page caching
  * Done at the server
  * Don't regenerate the page if it's requested again
  * As long as you know it hasn't changed
  * Page fragment caching, including "russian doll caching"
  * A key feature of good frameworks
