desc: We ask you to complete a simple self and peer assessment.
---
### Purpose

Assess your own and each of your teammates contribution to your team. Consider attendance and timeliness to the team meetings, contributions in words and deeds to the work and the deliverables, contribution to positivity and harmony, willingness to step in when things go wrong. 

Give yourself and your teammates each one a unique whole number rating 1 <= rating <= 9. Write up a very brief (1 or maximum 2 sentence) explanation of the rating. **Do not give the same number to two people.** Follow this scale:

* **9 means**: "This person carried the team. They were a great leader, listened and motivated all of us; they had great ideas and did a lot or most of the writing. We would be nowhere without them!"

* **1 means** "We succeeded despite this person. They didn't show up for meetings and when they did they were disruptive. They contributed no ideas. They were annoying."    

### Here's an example:

* Pierre Stone (me): Was present for all meetings, feels like I was the leader. Kept track of deliverables and wrote a major section of the report -> 7
* Oleana Root: Pretty good, tried hard to help and was reliable. Good worker -> 5
* Ronin Oscar: My partner who was as reliable and had a lot of key ideas. Figured out the pricing model and did a great job on the mockup -> 4
* Chris Abelson: Missed so many meetings, even when promised didnâ€™t show up. Nice person though! -> 1

### To Meet Expectations

* Simply follow the instructions above.
