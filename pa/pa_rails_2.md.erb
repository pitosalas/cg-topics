#### Continuation
(click here to go back to <%= link_to_topic :pa_rails_1 %>)

Continuing from PA Rails 2 we will now allow the user to request to sign up for the course (fake of course :) There will be a new Search page which will help the user to find courses to sign up to, and then an enroll button to further allow them to sign up to it.

####Part 2: Course Enrollment, Search
1. Add a model/table called Enrollment linking users and courses (a many-to-many association).
1. Add a fifth page to your app called Search. In the search page have a search form allowing users to search for courses by specifying a course name and/or subject using dropdowns. Remember that a subject has zero to many courses. If the user specifies a course name and a subject, both constraints should apply. Your subject dropdown should be populated using data from the database. The course name should be a text field. When the search/submit button is clicked in the form the app should display a list of all matching courses in a new results page.
1. Each of your search results should have a button called “Enroll” which when clicked will enroll a user in that course.
1. Modify the Home page to list all the courses that a user is enrolled in
1. Continue using Bootstrap to make the pages look good.
