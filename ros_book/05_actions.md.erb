title: "5: Actions"
desc: What are ROS actions and how do they relate to topics and services?
---
#### Review
* Nodes: all code written for ROS is a Node
  * A node is like a process
  * You run it with, e.g. `$ rosrun`
* Topics: the fundamental way nodes communicate with each other
  * Topic naames
  * Publishers and Subscribers
  * Message with data types
* Services: Synchronous communication
  * Client/Server
  * Ask and answer
  * Like a function call

#### Actions
* For long running activities, for example, navigate to somewhere
  * Activity is initiated
  * Activity announces that it has terminated (successfully or not.)
  * From time to time it reports its progress
* When defined as an action, this corresponds to three submessages
  * Part1: the goal (initiate the request)
  * Part2: the result (report completion)
  * Part3: the action is running (status update)
* See [Github Code](http://www.github.com/campusrover/rosbook)


#### Creating an Action
* Analogous to topics and services
* File now has three sections corresponding to the goal, result and feedback
* Some tricky updates to CMakeList.txt and package.xml
* `cm` for Catkin_make

#### Action Server
* Handles the three submessages (see simple_action_server.py)
  1. Initialize node
  1. Declare that we want to serve action requests and start it
  1. Wait for callback to be called.
* Run the server
  1. Notice that there are now 5 topics generated from that one Timer.action file
  1. Notice that the messages associated with the actions also have had more information atached to them

#### Action Client
* Node which will now ask request an action
  1. Initialize node
  1. Declare that we want to be an action client, and start it
  1. Begin the ball rolling by sending the goal to the action server
  1. Now block and wait for the action to complete.
* Run the client
  1. Notice that it displays the result of the fake action

#### Getting fancier - Server
* Callback of the sever handles all three parts
* First called when the goal is sent
  1. Check whether the goal is reasonable and abort if not.
  1. Begin performing the action.
  1. Reguarly check whether preemption was requested
  1. Whenever desired, send a feedback message
  1. When done send completion message.

#### Getting fancier -- Client
* Create node
* Connect to action server
* Send it the goal, while declaring handler for feedback calls
* Wait for completion or abort.
