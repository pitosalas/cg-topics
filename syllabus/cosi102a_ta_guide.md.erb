## General

* Textbook is still "The Lean Startup". 
    * Get yourself a copy and re-read it. It is crucial that you remember the terms and what they mean. I expect you to be comfortable with the content of the book and the content of the lectures.

* Our major goal - rewarding learning experience
    * The class is getting bigger each year. 
    * I am really counting on your proactive involvement to help me make this course work. 
    * We are all here for the students, yes trite but true. 
    * Our goal is that students feel that their hard work will pay off and be worthwhile for their time and efforts.

* Be flexible - Anything is possible
    * All of us will bend over backwards to help any student who wants to put in the work to be successful. We will be flexible and open minded about how this happens. 
    * We will reconsider any aspect of how the course is taught or graded if there is a reason to think it’s not effective.

* Eyes and Ears - Help me know what's going on
    * **You are our eyes, ears and voice with the students!** 
    * I hope you take this to heart and do what it takes to make this class and thes students' experience a great one. * When and if you get to a point in the semester where you're just not into it anymore or are collapsing under time pressure and are phoning it in -- let us know and we will find another student to take your place with no hard feelings!

* Time Investment - 
    * Depends on yuour role
    * You should assume about 5-7 hours per week on average.

* Academic Honesty
    * You should understand the [Academic Honesty](http://cosi12b.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/content/resources/01_honesty.md/) standards and policies and be part of the early warning system if you feel that something is happening that is not right.

## Specific Responsibilities

1. Tracking and scoring homeworks. 
    * You all know that my courses have a fair bit of homework. 
    * A lot of it is participation-only (i.e. pass-fail). For those you need to give them a general look to decide if they get a 100 (a good effort) or 0 (otherwise.) Of course remember the 20 point deduction for non-pdf submissions and the second 20 point deduction if the student's name is not IN the pdf. 

1. TA Partner
    * This is the rewarding and more interesting part.
    * As you know, around week 4 we form 4 person teams to do the term project. While there is a detailed roadmap for the students, often they will need leadership, from you. With 60 students or so we will have 15 teams or so, which means 3-4 teams per TA.

1. Producer - In lecture support
    * Monitor participation and record notes about individual students
    * Monitor chat and either answer questions or interrupt me
    * If I use discovery teaching then monitor that

## Your role as TA Partner is as follows:

* Get to know the students on the team so they are really comfortable with you.
* Make sure that they schedule a weekly team meeting at a certain time and place. 
    * This often is hard. Remember you have the authority as TA to insist on this.
    * If they can't seem to agree on a time and place, and you can't get them there, get me involved.
* Read their intermediate deliverables and help them make them really good. 
    * Give any and all feedback short of writing for them. 
    * Meet with them at least once every two weeks. 
    * And log the results of that meeting: when it was, and your assessment of how well they are working together and their progress so far

## FAQ on grading

* **When should homeworks be handed in and how are late penalties allocated?** 
    * The general model is that I set up Latte so that a homework is due on the day and time of the lecture in question, and has to be handed in by then other wise it is “late”. And second that the cutoff for submitting anything is exactly 3 days after that. 
    * So when you grade stuff you should check if it’s on time and if late deduct 20 points. (By the way, deduct another 20 points if it’s a text document and not pdf and/or the students name or assignment number is not at the top of the document.) The point deduction is done “by hand” by the TA.

* **Dealing with scale**: 
    * With 50+ students it will make sense for you to divide up the grading between the TAs. The Lead TA will coordinate this.
