* Make sure you also understand <%= link_to_topic :www %> this well

#### Goal
* Service Oriented Architecture
* Build a system from a collection of services
* Services talk to each other over the internal network
* REST or similar communications schemes
* Services that are internal to the system
* Not designed as an external API but as a way to structure a system
* Contrast with Rails "Majestic Monolith" approaches
* Big design and architecture question is how many services to have
* What is the "right size"?
* A very important pattern, but not uncontroversial

#### Benefits of SOA
* Isolation
  * Each service is its own code base, database, and team
  * Each can be tested separately
  * Makes "scaling out" more possible
* Robustness
  * If one service fails or errors out, it shouldn't affect the others
  * Analogous to encapsulation in OOP
* Scalability
  * Services become the unit of scalability
  * We can run 1,2,3 or more of the same service
  * A service can be moved to another server
* Flexibility and Interoperability
  * No service can know or depend on how another service is implemented
  * Services will interoperate without worrying about the language or platform
  * Or it could be reimplemented in another language or another platform
* Reuse
  * A service that is well designed can be reused in different contexts
  * There are services that different applications or products will require
  * Or a service designed by one group or company can be reused

#### Mechanics
* Describe the "API" of the service
* Usually an HTTP request and response
* Long running services should be implemented as multiple calls
  * One to initiate
  * One to request results if any
  * So as not to "block" the caller
  * But then, what happens if the service has crashed or is hung?
* Synchronous calls need to be very fast
* Another excellent way to communicate is with a queue
* Sinatra is especially suited for SOA services because it is lightweight

#### Discussion Questions

* How would you recognize a system that is designed in an Service Oriented Architecture?
* What are some of the advantages and disadvantages of this approach?
* What is in an http response? And what would be somewhat different about the http response produced from an SOA system?
