* You can't manage what you don't measure. What gets measured gets managed
* <%= discussion "What is a metric? Examples?" %>
* Vanity vs. Actionable metrics
	* The fact that I have more users today than I did last week doesn't mean that much
	* You need to know what you are trying to optimize for
	* Then you need to figure out what changes improve those variables
	* Only then can you tell if it's a good thing that you have more users today!
	* <%= discussion "What are some examples of metrics? How could we tel if they are vanity or not?" %>
* Useful Metrics are
	* Actionable:
		* You can use them to figure out what to do, or what you did, to cause the change. 
		* Need to know what to do to get more of that result
	* Transparent: Publish metrics to the team
	* Accessible: Make the definition of what's being measured clear. No made up words or jargon.
	* Auditable: Make it easy to see the underlying raw data
* But, beware of 'vanity metrics!'
	* More users today than yesterday? Not enough.
	* How do I change it. What changes will affect what metrics?
	* You can make changes, but will they matter to customers?
* <%= discussion "How do you decide what metrics matter?" %>
