title: NT Design and Architecture
desc: High level architectural guidelines
---

The objective of the NT project is to give you hands-on experience designing a simple system which will expose and exercise issues of scale. There is lot of room for creativity. There is a certain amount of guidance in the instructions, but you are welcome to diverge from it, and in fact in some places some interesting alternatives are presented.

#### Design
The "spec" for NanoTwitter doesn't dictate anything about the architecture. It is all specified from the outside in: <%= link_to_topic :nt_functionality %>. Beyond that specification, there's no expectation that the product "look" like twitter. There's wide freedom in the particular user interface. Our requirements are basic: good fit and finish, a workman like appearance, reasonbable usability. However there's no expectation to go beyond that with fancy animation or similar decorations.

#### Implementation
It would be surprising to see an implementation in something other than Ruby and Sinatra. The specified <%= link_to_topic :nt_functionality %> is not comprehensive. To make it complete you will have to fill in many blanks in fairly obvious places. Beyond that there's lots of flexibility: certainly there are other databases than SQL, and there are other Caching services and Cloud services. The focus in the implementation will be on scalability, and application of as many of the scalability structures covered as possible, and even some not coverted. As long as the functionality is as specified, anything is fair game.

#### Test automation, and Continuous Ingergration and Testing
NT will be deployed as a service in the cloud. Our base case is to use Heroku but again there are other variations that are possible which are equally valid. The NT code will have automated unit test that can be run at will to check for new bugs. The base case will be to use ruby's minitest package. There should be a serious attempt at good test coverage. Any tools that the team discovers to support the overall test, devops, and automation story are possible. In addition to writing and running tests, you will be using a continuous integration and testing service to make sure that you don't deploy before running all your tests.

#### Going beyond
Teams that go beyond the core requirements will be recognized. There are lots of ways to go beyond the core, and recalling that the core-core goal is great scalability. Here are some other ideas, an incomplete list to be sure:

* Use a nosql database
* Use some kind of page caching (like turbolinks or other)
* Write a twitter client to use and prove your REST Api
* Figure out a way to run a live test with real users to see how your twitter does with people
* Implement database sharing or partitioning (which would otherwise not be needed for the number of users our test set has)
* Do a great job identifying classes beyond the obvious ones
* Design a true microservice architecture
* Use one of the API definition languages to formalize your API
* Use GraphQL instead of the API described by the spec
