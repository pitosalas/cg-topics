### Keys to success

## Product understanding

In your slides and presentation you must demonstrate solid understanding of your product and convey this to your audience.

* Know your product:
    * Everyone on your team must know all the fundamentals of your product (what is it and what is it not)
    * What technical things must you tackle?
    * You've done a lot more than what can be shown in the presentation. Be ready to bring in research, numbers, out of the building results, into the conversation.
* Describe your product very clearly:
    * Make sure your audience understand the basics of your product as well as you do
* Be able to answer rudimentary questions about your product
    * Is there a big need for your product? Be specific.
    * Does your product solve the problem? How? Convince your audience a solution is needed and that you have the right solution.
c* Is there competition? How can you stand out?

## Business understanding

In your slides and presentation you must demonstrate solid understanding of your business and convey this to your audience.

* Have a basic business model and know it well
    * Everyone on your team must know the business model
    * Who are your customers? Can you reach them?
    * Does it make sense to make this product now?
* Revenue
    * Know your market size and make sure you have data to back that up
    * Know your price and make sure it makes sense
    * Market size x price = revenue
* Expenses
    * How much will it cost to make the product?
    * Will you hire people? How much will hiring people cost you?
    * Will you outsource? How much will that cost?
    * How will you maintain your product? How much will that cost?

##Presenting

* Be ready to present
    * Prepare and show that you prepared by having every team member speak and have clean slides that don’t include bullet points as much as data and pictures to back up what you are saying.
    * Every slide must serve a purpose
    * Maintain eye contact with
* Know what you will say and how you will say it
    * Have an intro, middle, and conclusion
    * Use a clear voice and correct, precise pronunciation of terms. Maintain eye contact with judges

    * Don’t be fazed by negative feedback
    * Teams who can rebound and ask questions about what they can do better will learn more
