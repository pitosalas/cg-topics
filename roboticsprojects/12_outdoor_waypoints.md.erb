title: "Project: Outdoor MVP"
desc: Most basic implementation stages of an outdoor navigating robot
---
#### Introduction
The goal here is to build the most fundamental parts of campus rover, in a way that will be easily expanded upon. You should complete the project with a rover that can decide on a path from one building to another, and avoid basic along the way.

#### Steps
1. Waypoint navigation
  * Have the robot navigate to a specific GPS point, on a favorable surface without obstacles
  * Detect when it's reached a waypoint (it won't ever be perfectly on the point, pick a good waypoint radius)
  * Navigate through a series of waypoints
1. Obstacle avoidance
  * Make slight deviations in the path to a waypoint to avoid obstacles
  * Don't worry about maze-like obstacles, solve those with more waypoints
  * Test with multiple waypoints
1. Path planning
  * Plot several waypoints around an area
  * Assign values to cost-of-travel between waypoints
  * Implement an algorithm that generates a series of waypoints, given start and destination waypoints
1. Put it all together
  * Set up obstacle course, with a few options from start to finish
  * Plot waypoints and assign cost
  * Watch your robot work perfectly!
