title: Self and Peer assessments
---
* **Self and Peer Assessments:** Assess your own and each of your teammates contribution to your team. Consider attendance and timeliness to the team meetings, contributions in words and deeds to the work and the deliverables, contribution to positivity and harmony, willingness to step in when things go wrong. 

* Give yourself and your teammates each one a unique whole number rating 1 and 9 and write up a very 1 or maximum 2 sentence explanation of the rating. **Do not give the same number to two people.** Follow this scale:

* **9 means**: "This person carried the team. They were a great leader, listened and motivated all of us; they had great ideas and did a lot or most of the writing. We would be nowhere without them!"

* **1 means** "We succeeded despite this person. They didn't show up for meetings and when they did they were disruptive. They contributed no ideas. They were annoying."
