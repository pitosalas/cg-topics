desc: Prototype or mockup of user experience, but on paper

#### Description
It is possible to design one or more screens of an app or mobile app or web app on paper. These can be eitehr sketched, or use tools like Balsamiq or Photoshop. The main point is that they are quicker and far cheaper to make. This has the effect of making us be less "attached" to them (because we didn't spend as much time on them) and so  make it easier to change or even throw out.

#### Watch out for
* Investing too much time in the paper prototype. The whole idea is that they are quick and dirty.

#### When to use
* Excellent for basic usability testing of screens and features of a product
