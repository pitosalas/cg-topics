title: POODR 3
---
* Read (POODR) Chapter 3. Points to understand:
  * Gear and Wheel have several kinds of dependencies. What are they?
  * Why are dependencies bad?
  * How are things improved when (on page 41) wheel becomes an input to the initializer?
  * Why does she keep using the term "messages"?
  * What is dependency direction, how can it be changed, and how do you know which is preferred?
  * *You are required to do all the examples, by typing them in yourself and getting them to work. Remember that your work should be happening inside your, directory `POODR`.
