##### Independent Study
Students  will be given a general direction to go, and a series of intermediate goals, but will be studying and working mostly indpependently (or in small teams). We will supply robots to work with, and other required hardware and space, and extensive guidance to resources, videos and exercises.

##### Grading
Because of the experimental nature of the course, and the fact that hardware is hardware, and the fact that we may discover new more interesting directions to go, your grade will partially be on your final project. But less obvious is that this course will morph as it progresses and you are expected to be part of that process, guiding, suggesting, trying and pushing. So, the other part of the grade will be based on your own commitment, inventiveness, creativity, motivation and teamwork.

##### Team Work
Much of the work will be in teams. Some of the steps will have teams of 2 or so students, but the bigger ones will have teams of 5 or maybe even all students together.
