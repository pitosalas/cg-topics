title: HW on Strategic Thinking for the Entrepreneur
---
1.  <%= pdfbadge %> **Strategic Analysis**: An entrepreneur has to learn to think strategically, analytically and carefully when evaluating what to do, how to do it, and what to do next. Read [Delivery Startups are Back like it's 1999](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/24/magazine/delivery-start-ups-are-back-like-its-1999.html) and [Food Delivery's Untapped Opportunity](https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/16/food-deliverys-untapped-opportunity/). Think about the idea of a delivery startup on campus. What might be some of the advantages of targeting college students? What are characteristics of them as a customer base which would make it hard for a fedex or amazon to deliver to them? What are some of their needs which might be different and hard to meet by a general business? How would you test some of these questions and assumptions? What kinds of products might be amenable? Is there room to capitalize on the slowness of the mailroom? What products, services, customers, campuses, geographies, and any other characteristics might be relevant? Is this a worthwhile idea to pursue? <%= deliverable "Write up your thoughts on some of the questions I raise above. Submit to Latte as a 1 page pdf." %>
