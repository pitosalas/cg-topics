title: Books for Cosi 166b
---
Note that we will be using Ruby 2.4 and Rails 5.1.

Here are the books that we will be using in this course:

* **Online and free** [Ruby on Rails Tutorial](https://www.railstutorial.org/book) [RRT\] Starting last year, this has become our main "textbook"

* **Online and free** [Learn Ruby The Hard Way](http://learnrubythehardway.org/book/): [LRHW\] A great online resource for learning to program Ruby quickly. We will use this during the first few weeks of class

* **Optional** [Agile Web Development with Rails 5.1](https://pragprog.com/book/rails51/agile-web-development-with-rails-51): [AWDR\] There are many books out about this topic. This particular one is the most popular and best, although if you want to go deeper I can recommend some others. There will be many readings from this book.
