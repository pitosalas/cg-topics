title: Ideas for visuals
---
What kinds of visuals make sense? Web sites, sketches, photographs, diagrams or flow charts are all possibilities. Realize that you also need to quantify your work before being able to create any visuals to demonstrate it. Things you can quantify include but are not limited to: estimate of your company's financial state (including expected revenues and expenses), costs of different marketing strategies, and your budget for the first year. Once you have numbers, visualizing them becomes a matter of choosing the right format (see [these ](https://visme.co/blog/types-of-graphs/]
for inspiration).

Here are a few more visuals you could include in your report: competition feature grid where you include the companies who will compete with you and compare their features with yours ([for example](https://blog.infodiagram.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/comparison_tables2.jpg) a feature grid for your different subscription plans (if applicable), and a customer acquisition graph to demonstrate which channels you anticipate will get you more attention (see: [this for more ideas](https://i.marketingprofs.com/assets/images/daily-data-point/customer-acquistion-channel-growth-custora-2013.jpg
)

Finally, remember not to include all your raw data but only that which fits your narrative. You won't be graded based on how many fancy graphs you have. We encourage you to use these visuals as tools to clarify your content.
