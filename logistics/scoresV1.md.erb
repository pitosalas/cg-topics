title: Assignment Scoring V1
---
Assignments are scored (not graded) on a 10 point scale, as follows:

* 10-8: Really excellent submissions. Correct and complete. Brings in outside sources or experiences. Well written and thoughtful.
* 7-5: Workmanlike submission. Meets expecations. Responds to the assignment in a reasonable way.
* 4,3,2,1: Disappointing submission. Incomplete. Misunderstanding at a basic level. Casual. Badly worded. Doesn't look like any effort went into it.
* 0: Didn't hand in work

If you need to map it to a letter grade, it might look like this:

* 10 - A+
* 9 - A
* 8 - A-
* 7 - B+
* 6 - B
* 5 - B-
* 4 - 
* 3,2,1 
* 0 - incomplete
