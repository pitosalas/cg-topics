### P2PTours - Peer to Peer Tours

*"Our vision is that using just a cellphone, travelers can now get access to a huge and wonderful collection of local tours, recorded by local experts, for free or for a nominal fee.*

*Imagine: you walk into St. Peter's Square and choose which local expert you want to listen to: a historian? A priest? An architect? A chef? Each one will have their unique perspective and will enhance your visit in their own unique way!*
