title: Portfolio
--- 
Throughout this course there will be many programming homeworks. You will be organizing them into a coursework portfolio directory with a very specific structure on your computer. That directory will be shared (automatically) with the TAs and Professor/

<%= callout("IMPORTANT", " You are required to organize your portfolio in a very specific way so that we can automatically review your work. Look way below for the specifics for this particular course.") %>

##### Why
In addition to formally grading an assignment that spans multiple classes, in some cases it is very useful to receive help or feedback along the way. By working in your portfolio we will be able to pay attention to your work in progress.

Secondly, at the end of the course you will have a nicely organized set of code that you wrote that you will be able to use for your own portfolio as you go out into the world.

##### Grading
Every Monday TA will look at your portfolio directory and give it a progress score based on:
1. How current you are with the assignment
1. How well you are applying learnings so far

This grade is not meant to assess your work but to give you useful feedback and possibly help to ensure that your actual submission will get a good grade. It counts very little towards your final grade, as part of class participation.

The progress score will simply be:

* 100: You've made reasonable progress
* 90: You seem to be behind or stuck or otherwise having challenges
* 80: You have not submitted anything

##### Submitting the actual deliverable
There will be a specific date by which the assignment should be completed, just like any other homework. After that date, the assignment will be scored in the usual way according to a rubric.

##### Example
* On Jan 1 the homework is "Begin working on movies-1"
* On Jan 5 the homework is "Continue working on movies-1"
* On Jan 8 the homework is "Complete and submit movies-1 for grading"

What is in your movies-1 portfolio directory on Jan 5 will be scored for progress. And what is in your movies-1 portfolio directory on Jan 8 will be scored as a formally homework submitted.

##### Directory structure
These rules are very specific because we use an automated grading tool (RoboGrade) to do a first pass on your work.

1. Your portfolio directory is called `<coursenumber>_<yourbrandeisid>`. So for example, it might be cosi166b_cburkh/. Note that the `<coursenumber>` is complete and all lower case and your `<brandeisid>` is the part of your brandeis email before the @brandeis.edu
1. Inside the portfolio directory there will be folders with very specific names that will be indicated as part of the homework. So for example, ./movies-1.

##### Dropbox for sharing the directories with us
1. Download and install the Dropbox Desktop application from https://www.dropbox.com/install
1. This will create a Dropbox folder on your local machine.  Within this folder, create a folder named `<coursenumber>_<yourbrandeisid>`.  This will serve as the top-level portfolio directory.  
1. Using the Dropbox web interface, share this folder with the TAs and instructor.  To do this, select the folder, press the **Share** dropdown, select invite people to collaborate, and add their emails.
