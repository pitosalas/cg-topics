desc: Simulating behavior in simulation

<%= callout("NOTE!", " All the book instructions make reference to \"turtlebot_xxx\". We will be using \"turtlebot3_xxx\"") %>

#### Intro
* We will modify the instructions from the book so follow along here!
* Code will be part of `rosbook` package which we have been using: [Github for Rosbook](https://github.com/campusrover/rosbook)
* Setup the simulation packages for Turtlebot3 by following [11. Simulation](http://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/simulation/). In particular make sure you add the turtlebot3_simulations package, as follows:

<%= code_begin %>
$ cd ~/catkin_ws/src/
$ git clone https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/turtlebot3_simulations.git
$ cd ~/catkin_ws && catkin_make
<%= code_end %>

#### Red Light/Green Light

* Pretty trivial, toe in the water
  * Drive forward for a bit
  * Stop.
  * Repeat
* Look at red_light_green_light.py
* Run code:

<%= code_begin %>
$ roslaunch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot_world.launch
$ ./red_light_green_light.py
<%= code_end %>

#### Reading sensor data
* TB3 has a lidar
* Lidar returns and array of 360 doubles (and some other stuff)
* 0 degrees is straight ahead
* Each element has distance to nearest obstacle (in M)
* Compute bearing (in degrees) of element i as follows:

<%= code_begin %>
bearing = msg.angle_min + i * msg.angle_max / len(msg.ranges)
<%= code_end %>

* To compute the distance to the obstacle immediately ahead (0 degrees)
  * `msg.ranges[0]`
* To compute the nearest obstacle:
  * nearest_obstacle = min(msg.ranges)
* But of course those won't be very useful (why?)

* Experiment by running laser_scan.py program and understanding it
* Experiment by seeing how the scan data changes based on where the simulated robot is

<%= code_begin %>
$ roslaunch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot_world.launch
$ rostopic echo scan
<%= code_end %>

#### Wander Bot
* Program will perform a pretty stupid trick
* It will drive in a straight line for some seconds
* Then it will spin in place for some more seconds
* If it is too near an obstacle then it will spin in place
* It turns out this is a pretty terrible algorithm
* It gets stuck all the time
* Take a look at the annotaed code: [Wander Bot Code](https://github.com/campusrover/rosbook/blob/master/scripts/wander.py)

* rospy.Time.now()
  * returns a time structure with
  * fields secs and nscecs
  * Comparison operator is defined
  * rospy.Duration(x) is an interval, in seconds

* Now run the program
<%= code_begin %>
$ roslaunch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot_world.launch
$ chmod +x  wander.py
$ ./wander.py
<%= code_end %>

#### Summary
* Logic in a .py program can estabish behaviors
* All .py programs become nodes (almost)
* Nodes can publish and subscribe, and do both at the same Time
* Need to know the exact names of the topics
* Simulator is used for an idealized context for testing
