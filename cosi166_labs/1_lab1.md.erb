## Plan for today

* This lab will be a guided independent programming session. Please do the following during lab while we are around to help everyone solve their problems.
* This is brand new so we don't know yet how much time it will take
* When you complete each section, ask a TA to come over so you can discuss what you achieved

## Environment
