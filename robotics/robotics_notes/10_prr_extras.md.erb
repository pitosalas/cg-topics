:slide_bigtitle Extra Information that will help with the textbook

**DON'T SKIP THIS**

We have provided a lot of extra information to make the book more useful to you! As a reminder, the textbook by O'Reilly is available for free from the Brandeis Library: [Programming Robots with ROS](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/programming-robots-with/9781449325480/ch01.html) In this course we refer to it as PRR.

:slide_title Here are the resources:

1. For each chapter I have provided one or two pages of commentary to clarify or supplement the chapter. They are listed below.
1. All the programs that are listed in the book are available to you inside your cluster account. These are corrected for our ROS distro "noetic". Save yourself a lot of time by using those. You can find them here:
    **`~/catkin_ws/src/cosi119_src`**
