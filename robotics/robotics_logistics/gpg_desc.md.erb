### GoPiGo3 Hardware Board

* Single Board Computer
* Motor Controllers and Software
* Further details
    * The GoPiGo3 hardware board contains an ATMEL ATMEGA328
    * The ATMEGA328 firmware is proprietary and no firmware documentation is released
    * The GoPiGo3 board receives commands from and returns data to the Raspberry Pi via SPI interface
    * The command set is enumerated in the SPI_MESSAGE_TYPE in gopigo3.py
    * The GoPiGo3 firmware monitors battery level, manages servo PWM, motor PID control, encoders
    * The GoPiGo3 board firmware manages the programmable “Grove” connectors
        * Analog Input on pin A or B
        * Digital Input or Output on pin A or B
        * Software I2C clock and data

### Rasberry Pi
* The Raspberry Pi is a famour general purpose SBC
* Runs Linux plus Dexter plus your sotfware
* Raspbian For Robots
    * service providing landing page to desktop and web based command shell
    * power button handler (/home/pi/Dexter/GoPiGo3/install/gpg3_power.sh)
    * GoPiGo3 Custom Desktop widgets
        * Software Update
        * Shutdown
        * GoPiGo3 Control Panel
        * Line Follower Calibration
        * Scratch For Robots
        * Advanced Communications applet
        * GoPiGo3 Folder shortcut to docs, all software
        * Version applet lists Raspbian For Robots version
        * Test and Troubleshoot Applet
    * Services
        * Customized Apache server
        * noVNC (in stretch version - I think real VNC in the buster version)
        * antenna_wifi.service to manage the multi-color WiFi LED
        * The schematic (and all software) is on github:
* Dexter software
    * a large library of drivers / examples for 3rd party “Grove” Analog, Digital, and I2C based sensors
    * drivers and examples for Dexter Industries sensors
        * VL53L0X I2C Time Of Flight Distance Sensor
        * BNO055 Inertial Measurement Sensor (Software I2C for clock stretching that RPi does not)
        * Temp/Humidity/Pressure Sensor, light color sensor, line follower, …
    * Phenomenal robot examples (/home/pi/Dexter/GoPiGo3/Projects)
