title: Conversions
---
* When you design your web presence, you need to decide clearly what *action* you want the visitor to take when they get there.
* How do you decide that? Well ask yourself, *why* do I need this web site?
* Do you want the user, e.g.
	* to register?
	* to place an order?
	* to like you on facebook
	* to download your app?
* When the user does the action, we call that 'a conversion'
* This is a term-of-art
* A web site can have more than one conversion.
* Exercise:
	* Break up into teams and pick one of the following sites and determine what their desired action is:
		* twitter.com, facebook.com, amazon.com, brandeis.edu, whitehose.gov, salas.com
* "A Good User Interface has high conversion rates and is easy to use. In other words, it's nice to both the business side as well as the people using it." Read this: [A good UI](http://goodui.org)
