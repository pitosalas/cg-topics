* Continue with [Learn Ruby The Hard Way](http://learnrubythehardway.org/book/preface.html). You should have completed lesson 44. You will learn about the wonders of arrays and hashes. Also one of the more advanced ruby features, modules. And now you start getting into somewhat more abstract stuff, object oriented analysis and design. Remember that your work should be happening inside your <%= link_to_intro :portfolio %>,, directory `hardway`.
