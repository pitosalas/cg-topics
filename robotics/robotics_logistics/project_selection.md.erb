:slide_title Background

A major part of this course is the design and completion of the Term Project. Students are welcome to come up with their own project ideas and assemble their own teams. This note will go over some of the parameters.
:slide_title Teams

The team should be a size appropriate to the project at hand. Likely most of the teams will be two students, but there might be one person projects and three person projects. The expectation is that the project writeup explains the need for the proposed number of students. You are welcome to propose your team members. This is just a propsal and we reserve the right to modify it by adding, removing or changing the makeup.

:slide_title Subject Matter

Any project which is closely related to Robotics, that uses Ros in an interesting way, is a valid option. Look at the list below for a series of ideas to prime the project pump. No one is required to pursue any of them; or you can take parts of one and parts of another. Depending on interest, we will create a special team to work on CampusRover itself.
