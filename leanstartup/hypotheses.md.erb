title: Hypotheses
---
##### The Lean Startup notion of hypotheses ("Scientific Method")
* Also 'assumptions', but I like the term hypothesis better because it emphasizes that we don't take a side as to whether it is true or not.
* We specifically want to generate evidence that will either prove or disprove it.
* Testable: You need to know how you would test it
* Explicit: You need to be able to state it succinctly (on a post-it note)

##### Types of Hypothesis - there are lots

* Customer: Who is the customer? Where would you find them?
* Problem: What is their pain? What is the 'job' they are 'hiring' a product to do?
* Solution: What kind of solution are they seeking? What features do they need? Will this solution actually address their problem?
* Pricing: Different tiers, prices, different customer segments
* Technology: What kind of computer, connectivity, sophsitication do they have
* Habits: "They do ..."
* Growth Hypothesis - Use will grow over time.
* Value Hypothesis - Like Solution Hypothesis

* The point is, don't get too hung up on classifications
* What is important is the idea of formulating testable hypotheses, running experiments, and updating your plans accordingly.
