title: What happens to a url
---
How does a browser process a URL? When I type http://www.salas.com:8080/toplevel?p=1 what happens inside the browser, what actions does it take, what messages does it send out, what messages does it receive? <%= deliverable "Research this on the web or in books and come up with a numbered list of actions, with each step in the list being a link to a source on the web that you used to figure that out." %>
