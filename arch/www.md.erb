## What does TCP/IP do?
* Sends a 'message' from one computer to another (often message is text)
* Destination computer is designated by a host or domain name
* Destination within the computer is designated by a port number
* The format or Interpretation of the 'message' is determined by the port
* Usually port 80 messages are interpreted as HTTP

### Use Telnet to experiment with TCP/IP
* TCP/IP sends and receives 'text' protocols
* Telnet utility
  * command line indicates the target host and port
  * Then you can type in the messages
  * What happens if I don't specify port 80?

<%= code_begin %>
telnet example.com 80
GET /index.html HTTP/1.1
Host: www.example.com
<%= code_end %>

## Formats and protocols
* What do those words mean?
  * A convention
  * Gives meaning to "bits on the wire"
  * Example:
* 3 critical protocols or formats
  * HTTP - Hyptertext Transfer ProtocolP
  * URI - Universal Resource Identifier
  * HTML - Hypertext Markup Language

* Actually there are a bunch more that are almost as important
  * CSS - Cascading Style Sheets
  * JS (or ECMA) - Javascript
  * More?

* All this is based on foundational Internet protocols
  * TCP/IP
  * DNS

* Dissecting the URI
  * Protocol
  * Host Name (see also: domain name, subdomain name)
  * Port (default for http is 80 and for telnet is 23, etc.)
  * Path
  * Parameters


### Review: What does HTTP do?
* Expects a "request" message which is answered by a "response"
* Request message
  * Defines a "method"
  * Defines the "path"
  * Supplies information about the format and lots of other stuff
* Response message
  * Defines a status code
  * Defines format of the response
  * Defines the response body

### HTTP Protocol
* Client makes a request (a packet is sent)
* Server Responds to the request (a packet is sent back)
* URL is on the "envelope" of the request
* Stateless

* HTTP Requests contain:
  * Request "method"
  * URL
    * Host name
    * Path
    * Parameters
  * Request Headers
  * Methods:
    * GET, HEAD, POST, PUT, DELETE, a few others

* HTTP Responses contain
  * Status code
  * Response headers:
    * Content-type
    * Content-length
    * Lots of other stuff

### Use an app to visualize HTTP
* Mac only: [Rested](http://www.helloresolven.com/portfolio/rested/)
* Other platforms: [rest-client](https://code.google.com/p/rest-client/)
* Mac version of [rest-client](https://github.com/mmattozzi/cocoa-rest-client)

### Review: How is the URL processed?

* URL: http://www.salas.com:80/toplevel?catalog=cosi goes:
  * http -> use http protocol
  * :80 -> over port 80
  * -> method is implictly GET
  * www.salas.com -> host www.salas.com
  * /toplevel -> the path
  * Params ->
    * catalog = "cosi"
