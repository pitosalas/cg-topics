title: Code Reading Practice
---
Some of you have said that you're interested in investing more time in becoming master programmers. One of the best ways of doing that is reading other people's code. I've selected 4 libraries that are all pretty small and digestable for your consideration.

Because I am currently teaching Ruby, these examples are all Ruby. But a similar list would be easy to build for other languages. While each language has some unique capabilities that will be exploited in examples, most of what you learn in these examples would apply equally to other languages

#### The list

* [SignalLamp](https://github.com/JEG2/signal_lamp)
* [TimeTress](https://github.com/kytrinyx/timetress)
* [Inflecto](https://github.com/mbj/inflecto)
* [MicroMachine](https://github.com/soveran/micromachine/blob/master/lib/micromachine.rb)

#### Proposed Process
1. Find a group of two or three other, equally passionate programmers and decide on one of these programs to study.
1. On your own study the library. Write a sample program using it so you really know what it is supposed to do. Read it on your own to orient yourself.
1. Get together around a single computer and go through the program, line by line and discuss and explain what it does, all the while tapping into the web and ruby documentation to follow up on questions that are raised.

##### Deliverable

Jointly write up a report on what you found, what you learned, and how you might improve the program. As you are not writing original code I do expect you to go fairly deep to show off your mastery of Ruby and Software Engineering. For example, you will see techniques that you've not seen before, or ways of using classes and objects that are new. I want you to make sure you understand what you see. You might make changes or improvements and make sure they are correct. You might demonstrate the technique in a sample program. You have some freedom depending on the project. Your report should include sample code as well but basically it should be like a paper. Submit as a pdf. Please submit it in the slot for Movies-1 and Movies-2. In other words, two students, each submit it twice. The same report.

##### Grading

The two members will get a grade for the written deliverable above and it will count as movies-1 and movies-2.
