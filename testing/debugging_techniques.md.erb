#### Debugging is a core skill

##### Sherlock Holmes Says [Quotes](http://sherlockholmesquotes.com)

* 'It is a capital mistake to theorize before one has data. Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of theories to suit facts.'
* 'I never guess. It is a shocking habit,—destructive to the logical faculty.'
* 'You know my method. It is founded upon the observation of trifles.'
* 'Eliminate all other factors, and the one which remains must be the truth.'

##### When things go wrong
* Code doesn't stop working on its own. When it stops working it's because something changed.
  * **First:** Blame yourself. It's probably something you are doing wrong. It's a normal, garden variety bug.
  * **Second:** Blame your environment: Something in the environment is different. It could be a version of a library or a service
  * **Third:** Look for a hidden dependency: Did your code somehow rely on the contents of this odd file? Does it work on my computer but not on yours?
  * **Fourth:** After all this, consider the possibility that there's an actual bug in the gem, the library, the compiler, or even the operating system.

##### Most challenging cases
* [Heisenbugs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heisenbug)
* Spanning Servers/Services
* Concurrency
* Test vs. Production

##### You have to understand what is going on
* Don't trust "magic".
* You need to be able to formulate a hypothesis of why something works. You need to take the time to understand
* Catch yourself getting into trial-and-error debugging: "Let me try this", "let me try that", "let me cut and paste this line from StackOverflow.""
  * Stop it!

##### Divide and conquer
* Write a "Hello world" demonstration of the bug.
  * Fewest lines to illustrate that you understand how something works.
  * Do you understand what it does, what the parameters are, what the return values are?
* Slash and Burn
  * If you really have no idea where the problem is
  * You can temporarily remove tons of lines of code until the problem stops happening
  * Binary Search
* When dealing with services over the network
  * Make sure you know exactly what is going "over the wire"
  * Can you demonstrate the bug without involving more than one system?
* Other standard Techniques
  * Rubber Ducking
  * Stack Overflow and similar communities

##### Debuggers
* All programming languages have a debugger of some kind.
* Core features are:
  * Run
  * Stop
  * Set Breakpoint
  * Step over
  * Step into
  * Examine state
* IDEs provide a fancier "Visual Debugging" interface

##### Logging
* Simple "printf" (puts)
* Use logging facility
* Logging levels: Info, Warning, Error, Severe
* Parsing log files
