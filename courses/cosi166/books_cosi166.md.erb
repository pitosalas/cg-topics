## Versions and "books"

Here are the books that we will be using in this course. These are all online and free!

* **Online and free** [Ruby on Rails Tutorial](https://www.railstutorial.org/book): There are many ways to learn Rails from books, tutorials, videos, or just the documentation. I have found this one to be one of the very best, and always updated.

* **Online and free** [Learn Ruby The Hard Way](http://learnrubythehardway.org/book/): A great online resource for learning to program Ruby quickly. We will use this during the first few weeks of class

* **Online and free** [GoRails](http://gorails.com): A great list of videos with examples of concepts you mayt want to implement in your Capstone project. GoRails also has a wonderful Slack community filled with Rails developers.

* **Optional** [Agile Web Development with Rails 6](https://pragprog.com/book/rails6/agile-web-development-with-rails-6: There are many books out about this topic. This particular one is the most popular and best, although if you want to go deeper I can recommend some others. There will be many readings from this book.
