title: Scaling

#### Scaling
* If you are interested in this topic, look at Cosi 105b, which covers it in much more depth!

#### Thought experiment
* Real world example: cafeteria flow chart
* Optimization:the search for bottlenecks.
* What's a bottleneck? Refer back to the cafeteria example.
* Moving target. 
		* When you eliminate/improve one bottleneck, it just reveals the next one. 
		* You make starting the dashboard activity faster....so that now you can notice that drawing the map overlay is slow.
* **Important:** Measurement
* **Worse sin:** Optimizing early. Why?

#### Performance
* Performance is what what a user experiences as "slow" or "fast"
* Response time to an operation initiated by the user
* Perception!
	* Can you 'fool' the user into thinking the app is faster than it is?
	* Feedback: spinners etc
	* Anticipation: start doing work before user requests it
* Different (but intertwined with) scaling

##### Scaling
* "How many X per minute can you do"
	* (e.g. user log ins, page refreshes, notifications,...
* How many (users, sessions, videos, pictures, etc) does the site need to support
* Different from response time: "How long does it take to accomplish Y?" Related but different
* Scaling has to do with the load on the servers
* Big challenge: how fast or slow will the site or app grow?
* Architectural techniques apply equally
	* scaling up vs. scaling out
	* caching
	* load balancing
	* database partitioning and sharding
	* asynchronous processing

#### Patterns of scaling problems and solutions

* "Clients" = web browsers accessing the site, mobile apps accessing the site, etc.
* Load on the servers. Some scenarios, one or more of:
	* Too many clients asking the server to do operation O
 	* Individual clients asking the server to do operation P too often
	* Operation Q is time consuming for the server to satisfy
* Solutions can be
	* Add an identical server to handle operations O, P or Q
	* Send operation O to one server and operation P to another server
	* Why are so many clients asking for O? Can we reduce the number?
	* What's the reason why a client would ask for operation P so often? Can we reduce that?
	* Is there a way to make operation Q faster to satisfy?

#### Techniques: Caching

* Save the result of a request with a given set of parameters.
* In a future request with the same parameter (maybe) return the same result
* Memoization: 
	* caching applied to an individual method
	* A basic programming technique
* System level caching. Storage:
	* In 'local' memory
	* In 'remote' memory
	* In database
	* In Cloud
* Name-value databases
	* Very fast searches and lookups
	* Distributed searches and distributed databases
	* Robust across system and application failures

#### Techniques: Asycnhronous processing
* Real examples: <%= discussion "What do all of these have in common?" %>
	* Account registraton confirmation emails (actually all emails)
	* Daily (periodic or episodic) notification emails
	* Automatic backups or archiving
	* Image Resizing
	* Spam checking

* Synchronous: Caller **waits** for response
* Asynchronous: Request returns immediately, but result comes later

* <%= nb "web server mainly responds to http requests!" %>
* Background processing happens even if no requests!
* How do processes work in a modern Operating System?
	* Scheduler part of the OS
	* Processes can be fairly heavy weight
	* Let's estimate how many background processs you would need
	* How would you handle processes that:
		* Were taking too long?
		* Had crashed?
		* Needed to be restarted?
		* Or what if the server crashes as a whole?
		* It's a mess. Need abstractions!

##### Case 1: Schedule based
* CRON jobs. Most elementary. Require "privileges"
* Alternative: Native "scheduler" application (e.g. Heroku Simple Job Scheduler)

	* [Rails Runner](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/command_line.html#rails-runner)

##### Case 2: Request based
* Request handled 'asynchronously' of course
* By local server, in a separate process
* By a remote server
* Request queueing
	* What happens when requests come faster than we can handle them
	* How do we add more performance in handling request

#### Techniques: Databases
<%= discussion "What if all the user names are stored in one table on one server?" %>

* Databases are a major bottleneck! Must move the data to more than one machine!
* Need to undertand the access pattern: read intensive/write intensive
* Database Replication
	* What does it do
	* What are the benefits
* Database Partitioning
	* What are the different kinds: Horizontal and Vertical
	* What does it do
	* What are the benefits
* Database Sharding
	* What does it do
	* What are the benefits
