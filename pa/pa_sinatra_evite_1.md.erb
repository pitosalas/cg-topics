title: Sinatra Evite 1
---
This is the next in a sequence of Programming Assignments to get you more and more comfortable with Sinatra.

* Start by reviewing the code you wrote based on [this tutorial: [Making a simple, database driven website with Sinatra and Heroku](http://samuelstern.wordpress.com/2012/11/28/making-a-simple-database-driven-website-with-sinatra-and-heroku/). I have provided the working source code here, as a reference: [SinatraDemo](https://github.com/pitosalas/sinatrademo)
* Your assignment is to create a similar Sinatra Application, except that instead of tracking "models" (whatever they are) it will be tracking people, events and registrations. You can think of this as a simplistic Evite.

Here is a suggested sequence:

1. Download that [SinatraDemo](https://github.com/pitosalas/sinatrademo) code, and run it and make sure you it does what you think it should do.
1. You will have three tables:
  * Person: name, date-of-birth, gender and zipcode
  * Events: name, date
  * Registrations: who is registering (person_id), what they are registering for (event_id), and status: a text field containing: coming, not comming, maybe.
1. Create the migrations for those three tables
1. At the url ./persons list all the persons
1. At the url ./events list all the events
1. At the url ./registrations list all the registrations
1. At the url ./person/new: display a form allowing the creation of a person
1. At the url ./event/new: display a form allowing the creation of a event
1. At the url ./registration/new: display a form allowing the creation of a registrations
