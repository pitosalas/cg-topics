title: Four Rules of Simple Design
---
#### What is software design?
* In software, "arranging code in a particular way"
  * Context matters: Are you writing throwaway code or software that someone will rely on?
  * What is "good design"? It's an aesthetic judgement, in a way
* What does it have to do with Scalability?
  * Applied to software engineering and methodology
  * Large codebase
  * Longer lived
  * Diversity of skills and individuals
* Is good design free?
  * YAGNI and BDUF
  * It requires more skillful developers
  * It requires investment and ongoing maintenance
  * Better than free, it will pay off!
* Even for tiny programs?
  * Usually its as easy to write a well designed program vs a poorly designed one
  * Finding the balance: effort and care proportional to cost over time!

##### Sandi Metz on Good Design
* **Transparent:** The opposite of "clever". Is it easy to understand? Can a programmer anticipate the consquences of a change?
* **Reasonable:** How easy is it to make a simple change? Do you have to rewrite a whole class? Simple changes should be simple, and deeper changes should be possible.
* **Usable:** One sign of good design is if it shows itself to be usable in new ways for new purposes that were not necessarily apparent originally.
* **Exemplary:** Are you proud to show it off? Would you want someone to use your code as an example?

##### Corey Haines on Simple Design

* Tests Pass:
  * Yes, you have to learn how to write tests and make it part of your practice
  * Doesn't have to be test-driven design
* Expresses Intent:
  * Yes, naming matters a lot.
  * Often as or more important than documentation
* No Duplication (DRY)
  * In the simplest sense, no textual duplication of lines of code
  * More important: No duplication of concepts or knowledge
* Small
  * Partly YAGNI
  * But also: remove code paths, classes, test data, examples, abstractions that are no longer used.
