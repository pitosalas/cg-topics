desc: Numerous prompts and sources of inspiration for your own product ideas

## Intro Notes
* These lists are just for inspiration
* You don't have to pick anything from here
* You can take an idea and add your own spin
* You can combine two ideas or build a subset

### Pandemic perspective

Consider how any of these ideas could be adjusted, improved, made more important by thinking about how it would work in the current pandemic. Maybe it has greatly increased importance if you look at it through that filter. 

### Sources of ideas
* [ProductHunt](https://www.producthunt.com) is a well known place where people post product ideas to get feedback. It is very active. By the way, it itself is a startup that recently got millions in funding.

* [Brandeis Student Projects](http://pitosalas.github.io/brandeisprojects/) is a list that I maintain of projects done by my students over the years. Your products will also be added to this list!

* [Indie Hackers](https://www.indiehackers.com/businesses) is another list of product and business ideas. Not as maintstream as Product Hunt but quite intersting!

* <%= link_to_topic :pitos_product_list %> is a list that I keep with ideas of mine that I've shown to everyone taking my courses. Some of them are good, some are bad, some have been tried others have not. Feel free to use any of them.

* Previous semester's pilot project visions: <%= link_to_topic :warmup_p2ptours %>, <%= link_to_topic :warmup_magic_travel %>, <%= link_to_topic :warmup_studentbuying %>, <%= link_to_topic :warmup_bodega20 %>.
