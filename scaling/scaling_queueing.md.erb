title: Scaling with Message Queueing
---

#### Thinking about Queueing

* SOA: Divide software into independent "services"
  * Client: code that needs the service
  * Server: code that implements the service
* Previously: SOA required REST between servers
* This is known as Synchronous - why?

##### Synchronous vs. Asynchronous

* Two basic ways to connect services in SOA
* Syncrhonous:
  1. Client makes a request (HTTP get) and waits
  1. Server Receives request
  1. Server does the service, during which client and server are waiting
  1. Server sends response
  1. Client is free to continue processing
* Asynchronous
  1. Client makes a request ('Publish' to a queue)
  1. Client can now continue
  1. Server picks next item off queue and does the service.
  1. When service complete, notifies client to use the result.
* That's the theoretical framework

#### A small case study
* Need: a service to send emails
* Example: nanoTwitter, user wants to be notified by email when they are followed

**In nanoTwitter Logic:**

* Decide on the contents of the email, as a template (e.g. erb)
* When a follow request is processed (during request handling)
  * Populate the template with info about who is following who
  * Retrieve the email address
  * Initiate the sending of the email

**How to initiate sending of email?**

1. Option 1: Inline:
  * Write a method which does the work, which will cause the email to be packaged up and sent to the mail server. Once the mail server accepts the email, execution continues.
  * Problems: Request handling is delayed and so the whole site hangs for each follow request: UNACCEPTABLE
1. Option 2: Seperate SOA / REST Service
  * Write a REST service (nanoTwitterEmailer) which accepts an EmailRequest and returns immediately to allow the main line code to continue. Email is sent to outside Mail server in a seperate process by nanoTwitterEmailer.
  * Problems: How are error handled? What if the REST Service crashes, or hangs? What if it is flooded with requests? How do we keep track of the emails that need to be sent?
1. Option 3: Message Queue
  * Use an EmailRequest message queue to collect info about the email that has to be sent in it's queue. Configure nanoTwitterEmailer to subscribe to a message queue and process the EmailRequests in the order they were submitted.
  * Result: The EmailRequest message queue robustly tracks the email requests. If the nanoTwitterEmailer dies, then when it comes back up the requests are still there. If there are too many requests, it's simple to run a second nanoTwitterEmailer.

#### Queues Conceptually
* Also known as "message queues", "publish/subscribe techniques", "message bus"
* Applications
  * Data delivery
  * Non-blocking operations
  * Push notifications
  * Publish / subscribe
  * Asynchronous processing
  * Work queues

##### Key Concepts
* Queues: Ordered, first in, first out, sequence of Messages
* Messages: Arbitrary (think JSON) data
* Message categories and types
* Publusher: program that may publish messages to a certain queue
* Subscriber: program that may look at and process messages from certain queues

##### Key operations
* Publish: place a message at the end of a certain queue
* Subscribe: get the first message in a queue (wait if needed)

#### RabbitMQ: One of several implementations
* Runs in a process of it's own
* Defines the following terminology
  * Producers: Software that sends messages
  * Consumers: Software that consumes (and processes) messages
  * Queues: FIFO "holding area"  for messages
  * Message: A bit of data which often incorporates an action or command
  * Exchange: Receives messages from producers, and sticks them into a queue
  * Acknowledgement: So that if the server dies before finishing, the message gets given to someone else
  * Durability: So that if the Queueing Service dies, the content of the queue survives
