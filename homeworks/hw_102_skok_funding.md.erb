1. <%= partbadge %> <%= pdfbadge %>View this [video by Michael Skok](http://www.startupsecrets.com/funding-strategies-to-go-the-distance), a well known venture capitalist.  I wonâ€™t cover all this financing strategy in this, but will focus more on how to think about milestones, capital and proof. Think about the following questions:
  * What's a term sheet? (No less than 3 sentences, no more than 5 :)
  * In the context of startup funding, what's "valuation"? (no less than 2 sentences, no more than 8)
  * One more question
  * What 1 or 2 important things from the reading did you not understand? And if you understood it all, then what 1 or 2 important things were most insightful/useful/valuable to you. Please make sure I can tell which is which!
  * <%= deliverable "Submit your answers to these questions in a pdf to latte" %>.
