title: HTTP - Hypertext Transfer Protocol
---
## HTTP is a network protocol

* Mental model: calling a function across a network
  1. Client is the caller
  1. Server is where the function exists
  1. Client receives the result

### Let's use telnet to make such a 'call'

<%= source_begin "language-bash" %>
$ telnet example.com 80
$ GET / HTTP/1.1
$ Host: example.com
<%= source_end %>

<slide_break></slide_break>

### Deconstructing the call

* "Call" includes:
  1. target host (example.com)
  1. target port on the host (80)
  1. HTTP verb: "GET" (a.k.a. method) (ref: [HTTP Method Definitions](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html))
  1. address: (the path or "/")
  1. Version of HTTP protocol (1.1)
  1.Datatype of required response (aka mime-type)
* There are lots of other "parameters" that are allowed in this call

### Deconstructing the returned data from that call

* (Reference: [HTTP Response Fields](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_header_fields))
* "Response" includes:
  1. Status code: 200 (see [HTTP Status Codes](http://httpstatus.es))
  1. **Content-Type: text/html** Tells recipient how to parse the result)
  1. **Content-Length: 1270** (Content following this is 1270 bytes)
* There are lots of other "parameters" that are allowed in this call
  * Accept-Ranges: bytes (lets the server tell the caller that it has that capability)
  * Cache-Control: max-age=604800, how long this response may be cached)
  * Date: Thu, 27 Feb 2014 00:33:26 GMT The current date time on the server)
  * Etag: "359670651" kind of a unique-id for caching purposes)
  * Expires: Thu, 06 Mar 2014 00:33:26 GMT (says when the page is required to expire)
  * Last-Modified: Fri, 09 Aug 2013 23:54:35 GMT (When this page was edited)
  * Server: ECS (ewr/1584) (Software running the server)
  * X-Cache: HIT (Page came out of a cache)
  * x-ec-custom-error: 1 (There was no error in the cache)
* All this is followed by data that we know should be interpreted as the Content-Type.

## What are the HTTP Methods

* GET, PUT, POST, DELETE (there are more, those are the most common ones)
* Think of them like a required first argument to the call
* The interpretation of the

## Simplified view of the world

* Think of the relationship between the client (the user in a browser) and the server (the rails server) as a program calling a function!
  1. **Call:** CallUsingHTTP("GET", "www.brandeis.edu", "/index.html")
  1. **Returns:** Status code, Content type, Content, and potentially more
