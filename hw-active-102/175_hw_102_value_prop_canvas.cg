* The purpose of this exercise is for you to better understand the value proposition your product is going after, as well as the customer segment that you are going after. 
* Read: [Achieve product Market Fit](http://businessmodelalchemist.com/blog/2012/08/achieve-product-market-fit-with-our-brand-new-value-proposition-designer.html). After reading it on your own, get together with your project team, spending 1-2 hours together. 
* Really read the article and try to understand the point. You will find its insights very very valuable. Based on the reading discuss and debate the "[Value Proposition Canvas](http://www.businessmodelgeneration.com/downloads/value_proposition_canvas.pdf)" and how it applies to your project specifically. Next actually fill in a copy of the canvas as a team. Discuss each box and what would go in it. 
* :team_deliverable "Write up the results of the discussion about your overall value proposition and customer segment. Also include your 'filled in' vp canvas. Dont worry about making it fancy just include the info. Submit to Latte as a pdf."
