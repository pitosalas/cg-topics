<%= callout("NB", " An in class exercise led by Karen Warner") %>

1. Locate the .pdf in Latte or in your email.
1. Page 1 is the most important. You will see phrases in vertical groups of 4. Read each group and circle one of the four phrases as the one that describes you, as a member of this class and project (as opposed to who you are with friends or family, which is probably different.) Don’t overthink the answer. Go fast but read all the phrases.
1. When you are done tally the results in the 4 boxes at the top. How many “C”s did you circle, how many “S” did you circle, etc. The total will be 24. 3) Look at pages 2,3,4 and mark up page 5 according to instructions there.
1. Follow instructions on page 7 to identify your style combinations. For example, I (Pito) and an Analyzer Persuader, and my alternate style is Analyzer Controller. Karen will tell us how good/evil that is. What are you?
1. Locate your style preferences on pages 8-18, read the description for yours. Circle the phrases that sound most like you and cross off the ones that sound least like you.
1. Bring your worksheets to class and submit for this assignment simply your preferred and alternate style.
