#### Planning functionality for Showcase Day Version (SDV)
* Instead of a final, this course will have a Showcase day where everyone presents and demos their products
* You will need to plan this Showcase Day Version of your product (SDV)
  * Think of this as the absolute minimum demo of your product that you want to have working by the product showcase. 
  * What is the essential coolness of your product? Can you demo that?
  * Remember a perfect login or user settings page is not essential coolness.
  * Think of the aha reaction you want in the viewer. 
  * Remember you can always exceed that!
* Narrow your focus!
  * Make a detailed mockup/paper prototype of your 1 or at most 2 core views your SDV will require
  * Detailed not because it has beautiful colors but because it covers the layout AND interactions that will work.
  * Everything from here on should be support that core view and nothing more!
  * Divide and conquer! Make sure each team member has a distinct deliverable!
  * Dig into the difficult things - don't avoid them in favor of the easy things!

#### The Walking Skeleton (WS)
* One of the principles of Agile development is to have running code as soonb as possible and all the time
* Sometime in 2 or so weeks you will have completed your "walking skeleton" version of the product
* It's called that because it will do almost nothing, just simply 'stand up'
* It might show one or two screens that does one little thing with a database with just one or two tables.
* It's purpose is to prove that you've gotten *something* running.
