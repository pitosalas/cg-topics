:h3 Key Take Aways from Chapter 1 - Start

* We don't have a 'methodology' for managing the startup process 
* This methodology applies to coming up with the right product for the right customer 
* Also to all the other pieces: pricing, customer acquisition, growth and scale 
* Engine of growth: whether or not each cycle of the company leads to growth or not. And if it does, by what mechanism? 
* Notion that a company or a startup needs constant data in to tell it whether it's heading in a direction and at a speed, vs. pointing it and giving it a huge shove. 
* Build-measure-learn: steers towards goal, pivot is a sharp turn 
* Analogy: driving to work, auto pilot, watching road and responding to local events vs. aiming a missile perfectly at a target (= dead reckoning) 
* Vision => Strategy => Product 
* In a big company or a new company, entrepreneur is the one who is trying to discover the product, basically to get to the start line. *
