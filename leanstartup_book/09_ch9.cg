## Discussion Guide


## Chapter summary: "Batch"

* Key Lean Insight: Small Batches
  * First adopted by Toyota in car manufacturing
  * "Supply Chain" management
  * "Just in time" manufacturing
  * "Toyota Production System"
* What is the fastest way to stuff envelopes
  * Two arguments:
    * Small batches detect problems earlier and allow them to be corrected
    * Less "work in progress" means less handling of half-completed work product
    * Less capital sitting around
* How Software Develoment used to be done
  * Waterfall (MRD, Product Spec, Architecture, Development, Testing)  
  * What are the problems?
  * Nowadays?
    * All are happening at once
    * Some companies "release" multiple times PER DAY!
  * Some of this is new concepts and some of it is enabled by new technology.
* IMVU Story
  * Design, develop, ship features one at a time
  * Able to get feedback fast
  * COntinuous deployment, including test and rollback
* Continuous Deployment
  * "Hardware is becoming software"
  * "Mass Custimization" (engraved iPhone!)
  * 3D Printing of parts (in SPACE!)
* Pull don't push
  * Look for the "demand" signal and work back from there
  * In software development, "YAGNI"


## Discussion Guide
* Do you really believe the envelope story?
* Examples that you know about that are "Small Batch" oriented
* And of processes that still use Large Batches
