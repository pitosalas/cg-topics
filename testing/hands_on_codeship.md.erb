title: Hands On Codeship
---
## Introduction
* [Codeship](https://codeship.com/) is one of a bunch of continuous integration services
* They all do a variant of this:
  * Monitor your github repository
  * Pull out the latest sources whenver there's a change
  * Run all the tests
  * If they pass, then send the code to Heroku for deployment
* Codeship](https://codeship.com/) is the one I've used most often to good success. But don't get hung up on that. New ones spring up and old ones die off.
* This hands on example assumes:
  * You have a working rails application which has some working tests
  * That it is on github in a PUBLIC repository
  * It works well as a follow up to <%= link_to_topic :hands_on_tiny_rails_demo %>

## Hands On
* Go to codeship.com
* Log in with your github account
* Click on "Create a new Project"
* Select the github icon (with the cat)
* Select the specific name of the public github repo
* Within "select your technology to prepopulate" choose Ruby on Rails
* Click "save and go to dashboard"

## Get it to work
* Go to your repo (in your shell)
* Modify any file in the directory (readme is a good choice)
* git commit --all; git push -m "first test"
* Keep an eye on the browser window displaying the "dashboard"
* If the tests pass, you should see "SUCCESS" in green
* You now have a green build!
* Congratulations!

## What's next
* You might now want to deploy your application to heroku
* Next in the process is <%= link_to_topic :hands_on_heroku %>
