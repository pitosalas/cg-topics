title: Scaling with Asynchronous processing
---
<%= callout("Each Team", " Plan to use asynchronous processing?") %>
### Scaling Pattern: Asycnhronous processing
* Real examples
  * Account registraton confirmation emails (actually all emails)
  * Daily (periodic or episodic) notification emails
  * Automatic backups or archiving
  * Image Resizing
  * Spam checking
* Synchronous: Caller **waits** for response
* Asynchronous: Request returns immediately, but result comes later

* Web server mainly responds to http requests!
* Background processing happens even if no requests!
* How do processes work in a modern Operating System?
  * Scheduler part of the OS
  * Processes can be fairly heavy weight
  * Let's estimate how many background processs you would need
  * How would you handle processes that:
    * Were taking too long?
    * Had crashed?
    * Needed to be restarted?
    * Or what if the server crashes as a whole?
    * It's a mess. Need abstractions!

##### Case 1: Schedule based
* CRON jobs. Most elementary. Require "privileges"
* Alternative: Native "scheduler" application (e.g. Heroku Simple Job Scheduler)

  * [Rails Runner](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/command_line.html#rails-runner) **Rails Only**

##### Case 2: Request based
* Request handled 'asynchronously' of course
* By local server, in a separate process
* By a remote server
* Request queueing
  * What happens when requests come faster than we can handle them
  * How do we add more performance in handling request
* SOA API
  * Make sure the API returns right away and requestor has a way to check status
