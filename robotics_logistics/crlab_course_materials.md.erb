##### Required Course Text Book

* [Programming Robots with ROS](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Robots-ROS-Practical-Introduction/dp/1449323898). This is an excellent book that introduces ROS from the bottom up. You should get a copy. Beware, ROS is pretty complicated. It's real-time, distributed operating system which is installed both on the robot and on the controlling laptop (if there is one). It can be quite difficult to configure and finnicky. But it is very very powerful!
