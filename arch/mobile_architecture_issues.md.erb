#### Server/Service Considerations

* Server
  * Practically all mobile apps are backed by a server
  * Do you own it or does it belong to a third party?
  * Can you change the API? Can the API change from under you?
  * What kind of information needs to be sent between mobile app and server?
* How to think about this information
	* How much data are we talking about?
	* What are user expectations of perforamnce and latency?
  * What should the app do when there's no network?
* Firewalls
	* Are there likely to be firewalls in the way?
	* Does the client have to reach the server, or vice versa or both?
* Protocols
	* Commonplace today is "REST" over "HTTP".
	* But all is changing all the time!
* Security
	* Authentication
	* Authorization
