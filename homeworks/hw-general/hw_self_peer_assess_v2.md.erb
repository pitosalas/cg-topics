title: Peer and Self Assessments
---
1. <%= partbadge %> <%= pdfbadge %> **Self and Peer Assessments:** Write a self and team assessment about you and your teammates work on the team. Please touch on: What each person on your team, including yourself, did on the team and took responsibility for. How reliable and constructive that person was. To what extent did they help the team succeed, was a pleasure to work with.

    Give each team member a grade, including yourself, and explain why you think they should get that grade. You might check "grading" under "Contribution to the team" to get an idea what to think about. Your post will be confidential and supplement the instructors' view on your contribution to your team. Make sure you mention the team members names. <%= deliverable "Posted on latte as a pdf" %>
