title: Scaling by Database Partitioning
---

### Scalability Pattern: Database Partitioning
* Conflicting definitions
  * When you divide a big database into several smaller ones
  * Partitioning: Horizontal and Vertical
  * Sharding; Horizontal Partitioning
* What's the problem?
  * When the database is the bottleneck
  * Add a second database server
  * What to do with the data?
* Some options
  * Replication: Put a complete copy of the data on the second db server
  * Pay attention to read vs. write
  * What to do about data consistency?
  * Parition

#### Example
* User Database
  * Happens to often be a monster
  * Lots of records
  * Each record with lots of information
  * Accessed a lot
* Schema
  * User: (id, name, email, biography, hobbies, college, last_login, encrypted_pw, profile_photo_jpg, ...)

#### Sharding (Horizontal partition)
* "buckets" of users (== shards)
* How? Create multiple database servers with
  * the same schema
  * different subset or clump of records
* Need a way to direct requests to the right "shard"
  * inspect something about the record
  * determine what shard to look in
  * Three common flavors to decide what bucket gets a record
    * Range Based: Range of some scalar value (record id, first letter of name, etc.)
    * List Based: Take some other property (e.g. zipcode, department)
    * Hash Based: Compute a hash on some value
* How it changes your application
  * Whenever you either read, write, or search
  * Require to include enough information to pick the right shard

#### Pros and Cons
* Joins become a problem
  * What was once one db is now spread over more than one db
  * Can lead to denormalization
* Data Integrity
  * Foreign keys might now point to another database
  * Databases can get out of sync

#### Vertical partition
* Often associated with an SOA
* Basically create n > 1 new tables with subsets of the columns

##### Team Discussion
* Would this make for a non-normalized situation?
* How would you break up your user table to achieve vertical partition?
* Where would your code change?
