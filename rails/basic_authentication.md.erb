## Rails Details for Authentication

<%= callout("NB", " Use Rails 6! These instructiosn won't work fully in earlier versions.") %>

### Intro

* There are several popular gems to implement authentication
* Beware that the fact that there is a gem does not mean that it's trivial
* You need to understand what's going on.
* Advice: Avoid getting fancy with initially, with devise, clearance, oauth, etc.
* Start with a simple password

### Create minimal Rails app
<pre><code class="language-ruby">rails new basic_auth_demo
cd basic_auth_demo
rails generate scaffold users name:string
rails db:create db:migrate</code></pre>

### has_secure_password
* Line added to top of the model representing what is logging in
* Might be Users, or Accounts, or whatever. The thing that logs in.
* Makes base assumptions about that model
* Database contains a field called password_digest (and does NOT contain a field called password)
* Implements various aspects of the authentication model
* Steps
  1. Add (uncomment) bcrypt gem to Gemfile; bundle update
  1. Add field `password_digest:string` to your User table
  1. Add this to the model User

<%= source_begin("language-ruby") %># add this to models/user.rb
include ActiveModel::SecurePassword
has_secure_password
<%= source_end %>

### Test out in the console
* See: * Reference: [Ruby Guides on Active Model](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_model_basics.html)

### password_digest, password, password_confirmation
* Database only stores password_digest
* Model logic supplied by has_secure_password
  * Computed a cryptographic hash (digest)
  * And store as password_digest

<%= source_begin("language-ruby") %>User.create(email: "tim@brandeis.edu", password: "abc", password_confirmation: "abc")
User.where(email: "tim@brandeis.edu").first.authenticate("abc")<%= source_end %>

### Sessions Controller
* Tricky: Session is not a model!
* Session controller maps a url (route) to some code
* Specifically code to execute when loging in and out
* session#new: display login box
* session#create: try validate password and save "logged in status"
* session#destroy: reset logged_in_status

<%= source_begin("language-ruby") %>rails g controller sessions new create login welcome 

# Add this to routes.rb
get 'login', to: 'sessions#new'
post 'login', to: 'sessions#create'
get 'welcome', to: 'sessions#welcome'
get 'logout', to: 'sessions#destroy'

# Add this to views/sessions/welcome.html.erb
<%%= button_to "Login", '/login', method: :get%>
<%%= button_to "Sign Up", '/users/new', method: :get%>

# Add this to views/users/_form.html.erb
<%%= form_for @user do |f|%>
  <%%= f.label :name%>
  <%%= f.text_field :name%>
  <%%= f.label :password%>
  <%%= f.password_field :password%>
  <%%= f.submit %>
<%% end %>

# Modify this line in users_controller.rb#user_params
params.require(:user).permit(:name, :email, :password, :password_confirmation)

<%= source_end %>

### Adding actual authentication
* Try this command `rails routes` to see how Rails is interpreting your `routes.rb` specification
* We now know how to manage users and passwords. Now lets check them.
* Session[] is used to store the user_id of logged in user
* Helper methods are used throughout
* Note how they in a very simple way use sessions and state to
  1. remember who is logged in
  1. And check whether someone is logged in

<%= source_begin "language-ruby" %>
module SessionsHelper
  # Logs in the given user.
  def log_in(user)
    session[:user_id] = user.id
  end

  # Returns the current logged-in user (if any).
  def current_user
    @current_user ||= User.find_by(id: session[:user_id])
  end

  # Returns true if the user is logged in, false otherwise.
  def logged_in?
    !current_user.nil?
  end

  # Logs out the current user.
  def log_out
    session.delete(:user_id)
    @current_user = nil
  end
end

# and add this to ApplicationController
include SessionsHelper

# Now start requiring log in (authorizatoin)
