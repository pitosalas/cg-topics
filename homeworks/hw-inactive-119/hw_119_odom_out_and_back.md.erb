## Introduction

This assignment will teach you how to write a ROS node that subscribes and publishes to topics, and uses odometry to control movement precisely. You will make the robot drive in an exact straight line or other shapes.

### Purpose

* Learn how to subscribe to ROS topics 
* Learn about how a single node can both subscribe and publish
* Learn about localization in ROS
* Understand odometry data
* Use odometry data for more precise movement

## Assignment

Use Odometry to drive in a  straight line for 1 meter, then turn around and drive back and end up in the same spot. Do your best to make the path straight and not wavy, wobbly or zig-zaggy.

### Fun ways to extend the basics

1. In addition to a straight line, also do other shapes, like a rectangle, or triangle or ... a circle!
1. Look up  `PID controls` and see if you can use that algorithm to smoothen out your route

### Deliverables

* Commented Python source code file(s)
* A readme.md file explaining the design of your code and anything else interesting or relevant
* Video of your program running in gazebo or your lab at home 
* Both submitted in Latte

### Steps

1. Import Odometry messages into python, e.g.  `from nav_msgs.msg import Odometry`
1. Subscribe to odometry topic `odom` and create a callback function to use as an argument, e.g.`example_sub = rospy.Subscriber('odom', Odometry, <name of callback function>)`
1. Write a callback for the odometry topic and add a control loop
1. After starting a gazebo simulation and publishing some `cmd_vel`'s print out `odometry.pose` and `odometry.twist` so you can see what odometry data looks like
1. You can choose to write the code in the odometry callback or in the main loop. There are advantages and disadvantages in both scenarios.

## Hints

* You can either modify existing code from the `samples` repo or write your own python ROS node
* The instructions will give you the pieces of code to get you started but the rest will be up to you
* Getting familiar with ROS documentation is a good idea
