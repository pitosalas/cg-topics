:h3 STDR GUIDE

Download stdr package and learn official tutorials on [stdr wiki](http://wiki.ros.org/stdr_simulator)


:h3 Basic workflow -  cheat sheet
1. open ROS server `roscore`

* open STDR server `source /opt/ros/kinetic/setup.bash`,
  * with a default map  `roslaunch stdr_launchers server_with_map_and_gui_plus_robot.launch`
  * with no map `roslaunch stdr_launchers server_no_map.launch`, and then **open your own map** (also see: [How to load a map](http://wiki.ros.org/stdr_simulator/Tutorials/How%20to%20load%20a%20map))
  * way1 : `rosrun stdr_server stdr_server_node maps/<your_own_maze.yaml>`
  * way2 : `roscd stdr_resources` ---> `rosrun stdr_server load_map maps/<your_own_maze.yaml>`

* open GUI visualizer. `roslaunch stdr_gui stdr_gui.launch`

* open RVIZ(optional).`roslaunch stdr_launchers rviz.launch`

* compile and run your script.`chmod +x rosmaze <your_own_script.py>`, then run `rosrun <workspace name> <your_own_script.py>`  *we recommand you put your own scripts in catkin_ws/src/stdr_simulator/stdr_samples.

:h3 How to register external map.

1. download/draw/get an image in **.png** format. *[online-format-converter](https://www.online-convert.com/)

1. put **your_own.png** in folder **catkin_ws/src/stdr_simulator/stdr_resources/maps**.

1. write a **your_own.yaml** file for your map, use the same format as other yaml files, notice change file name to match with your map name.

1. run: `sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /opt/ros/kinetic/share/stdr_resources/maps` This gives you the permission of editing this source folder (you might not need this line)

1. now you can put **your_own.png** and **your_own.yaml** in the folder **/opt/ros/kinetic/share/stdr_resources/maps**.

1. Finally, register the map, run `roscd stdr_resources` , then `rosservice call /stdr_server/load_static_map "mapFile: '$PWD/maps/<your_own.yaml>'"`.

:h3 Turtlebot Model in STDR

* We have written a yaml file that simulates a turtlebot with 360deg spinning lidar, get it here: [robot-model](https://github.com/celisun/STDR-simulation)
* To use, put this file in catkin_ws/src/stdr_simulator/stdr_resources/resources/robots(highly recommended) with all other robot model files, and load it on GUI or through stdr server on terminal.
* Feel free to make changes if necessary or write your own model file, the format reference [here](http://wiki.ros.org/stdr_simulator/Tutorials/Create%20resources%20using%20files).

* **Note:** the sonar sensors in three directions (in green) in this case are designed to help visualize the range of readings people usually use (front: 30deg, left/right: 20deg).
