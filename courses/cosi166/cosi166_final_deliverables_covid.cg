:h2 What to put into LATTE

* Presentation Slides (Powerpoint or similar) (not a link)
* Final Report (PDF) (not a link)
* Link to your team GitHub dir
* Link to your app running on Heroku
* Brandeis Project Text File

:h2 About the zoom meeting

* All team members must be there
* It will be semi-formal
* Team does the presentation
* Team does the demo
* Here are some general <%= link_to_topic :cosi166b_presentation_tips %>
* Pito and TA will save questions to the end:
    * about the presentation
    * about the implementation
    * about how the work was divided
    * Look at the code too

:h2 About the presentation

* You will no more than 10 minutes to present
* It is not required that every team member speak
* You should have powerpoint or similar slides
* This is more of a technical presentation, not a marketing or selling pitch
* N.B. This is not a rubric or a checklist
* You may add whatever you think is important to know

:h3 Slide sequence suggestions

* An opening slide
* One or more slides about the functionality
    * What user problem your product is meant to address
    * Exactly what the product does currently and if you had more time
* One or more slides about the technical side
    * How does it work? What is the technical architecture of the product?
    * A diagram of the architecture
    * What parts of it were especially challenging
    * Which ones go beyond the minimum Ruby on Rails
    * Which gems or other outside libraries or services you used
* One or more slides about the non-coding parts
    * What your approach was for testing and for continuous integration and deployment??
    * What you are most proud of
    * Where can your product be improved or expanded?
    * How you approached dividing the work between the team member
    * What did you learn about working on a team?
* A closing

### The product demo
* Take no more than 10 minutes to demo your product. 
* By now, you should be able to demonstrate your product!
* You do need to work on a demo 'script'
* The best demo scripts tell a bit of a story where you try to 'hook' the listener with a scenario that they recognize

### Final Report
* Purpose: explain what you did, how you did it, why you did it that way, what the challenges were, and what you would do next

* Structure: 
  * Submit a PDF of around 5-15 pages, no more. 
  * Use as many pages as are needed. 5 is likely too little and 15 is likely too much, with appropriate fonts, size, margins and spacing. 
  * Regarding citations: don't force it. If there's something specific that would add value then make a citation. No specific type of citation is prescribed. 

* Stylistic advice
  * Quality of an academic report or paper
  * This is a technical description of the product and project
  * We are looking for a well organized document describing the product and project
  * Check your English language writing, and use the Writing Center if needed
  * Watch out for run-on sentences that sound like transcribed spoken language which is not appropriate in a written report.
* Content advice
  * What the purpose of the product is, what kind of user would want it.
  * Summarize the functionality, but don't write a detailed page by page user guide.
  * Summarize the schema but don't go table by table, field by field in the narrative.
  * Technologies used, beyond just RoR. What new and unusual tools, services, languages, and so on.
  * Interesting Engineering, how did you go beyond a vanilla web app and have to confront some engineering challenges
  * Development, deployment and testing methodologies and results.
  * Inlude at least one screenshot and also a diagram of the architecture
  * Include names and emails of the team members

### Markdown file describing the project,
* Just following these simpleinstructions: <%= link_to_topic :brandeisprojects_listing %>.
* This will create the entry for your project in [BrandeisProjects](http://pitosalas.github.io/brandeisprojects/)
