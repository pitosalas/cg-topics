title: Zoom Icebreaker - 15 minutes
---
* I will put you in a breakout room
* Take turns answering any of the questions shown below.  
    * You can only answer one question with each turn. 
    * Somebody at random begins, says his/her name (nickname), repeats the question they want to answer, and then answers it. 
* After the answer, pick the next person
    * Turns are limited to at most 2 minutes
    * Somebody volunteer to be the time keeper. Once everybody has had a turn, start a second round.
* With thanks to [Rick Alterman](https://www.cs.brandeis.edu/~alterman/Welcome.html)
