title: Simple JavaScript Practice
---

:h3 Goal

* Understand more deeply how the browser and server work together
* Understand more deeply how javascript fits in

:h3 What you will learn

* Where forms are defined in rails
* How forms are executed and begin to understand remote processing

:h3 Steps

* Option 1 Create a new empty rails app with our new template
  * Use our new docker-rails-package to quickly set a new rails app
  * Go to [ruby-on-rails-pg-container](https://github.com/hojulian/ruby-on-rails-pg-devcontainer)
  * Read the instructions and use it as a template to create a new rails app
  * Remember to `bundle`
* Option 2 Create a new empty rails app
  * Create a new rails app in a new directory
* Add a scaffold
  * Add a very simple scaffold, one table, one field would be enough
  * Make sure it runs properly and that you can access it
* Read: [Working with JavaScript in Rails](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/working_with_javascript_in_rails.html)
* Experiment
  * Create a new record, and press the create button
  * Look closely at the server transcript (where you did `rails server`)
  * Look for the line that comes up as a result of the `POST` and the next line which will indicate whether html or json was returned
  * If html was returned then we are not using javascript. If JS was returned then we are using Javascript
  * You can choose the mode you want by adding local:true or local:false on the `form_with` line in the view
  * Determine by experimentation whether the default for local is true or false

:deliverable Explain what you did, what you think the default is, and how you figured that out.
