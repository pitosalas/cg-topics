* **Product Summary:**
When it comes to a volatile market, many people have rules of thumb about when to buy and when to sell. This can apply equally to stocks, securities of any kind, commodities like gold, or even bitcoin! Trade Assistant monitors the market according to your personal rules of thumb and alerts you by tweet or email with advice, e.g. "Buy 4 shares of Apple now", or "Sell $100 BTC now".

  The Trade Assistant does not do any trading! Instead it reminds you of your own buy and sell signals by email or text message. TA is not artificially intelligent, it simply applies your own rules of thumb. This can be most easily explained with an example. Here are some examples of the kinds of iTunes Smart Playlist-like rules that can be set up:

  * "Buy .1 BTC when price is below $500"
  * "Sell .05 BTC when the price is higher than the highest price it hit in the last 3 months"
  * "Buy 10 AAPL when the price is within 10% of the low for this year"
  * "Sell 10 AAPL every 2 weeks"

  TA monitors all the securities you are interested in and when one or more rules fire, it generates an alert by email, text message or tweet.

* **Elevator pitch:** Do you like to trade stocks? This product gives the amateur investor accesss to a powerful algorithmic trading tool to help then respond more quickly to the market.
