title: Self Knowledge Reflection
---

Reflect personally on what you have learned in this course about yourself. And reflect about how this course has affected the way you are professionally. Please avoid platitudes. It will be graded participation only but I will read every single one and give you feedback. Here are some questions to help you think about it:

*What latent interests have been reinforced? What did you discover you were not so interested in? What have you learned about the work you want to do in the future? based on your interests and your strenghts? Do you have more clarity there? Where do you know you want to learn a lot more?*
