title: Homework about team Alignment
---
1. <%= pdfbadge %> <%= teambadge %> **Team Alignment** Meet for at least 2 hours, face to face with your team and come up with your team's product vision with the following elements. Notice that for this exercise it is necessary to discuss each point in the team meeeting and articulate your answer in a fairly precise way that you all can accept. I realize that they are so far not tested; you will be able to improve and amend them in the coming days and weeks. The important thing at this point is that all team members engage and understand and agree with the vision as of now.
    * **Product Vision**: Your current vision of the product. Make it descriptive, not salesy. Remember the reader is not inside your head they will need to have it explained.
    * **Problems that it solves**: Continue your explanation by explicitly stating the list of 1 or 2 or 3 real world user problems that it solves. Make it pass the common sense tests. These should not be tiny silly problems but should be recognizable by the target users. Distinguish between problems you solve and pains you remove.
    * **Who is/are the customer/s**: Describe groups of users or customers in a way that keeps in mind how you might reach them. If your customers are "Higher Ed Students who are having trouble finishing their homework on time". How would you find them to talk to them and dig deeper? Also remember that your vision might include two disjoint sets of users or customers.
