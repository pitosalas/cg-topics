desc: One or more tools to teach robotics Concepts

I have found that it is tricky to teach how key algorithms like AMCL and SLAM work. One can teach it conceptually (which stays very superficial), mathematically (which requires more math than is appropriate) or by using ROS (which works but is purely magic, and doesn't help a student undetstand how it really works).

This idea is to develop one or more pedagogical simulations to help a student really undertstand how, for example, AMCL works. I have more specific ideas for any student who wants to discuss this.
