### Purpose of Engine of Growth Exercise

* Team collaboration always build effectiveness
* By thinking about these questions you will get a better understanding of your product or service
* And may see things to change and improve that have nothing to do with growth
* Get the team thinking carefully about their product and how they will get it to build up in numbers of users

### Activities
 
* We break out into teams
* Discuss all the ways in which you might achieve growth in your product or service
* Come up with a primary and secondary engine of growth
* Consider how you would get from 0 to 100, 100 to 1,000, 1,000 to 10,000
* Would you use the same engine of growth (which is fine but not required)
