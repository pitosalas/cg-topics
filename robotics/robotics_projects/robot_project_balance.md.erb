title: Balance Seesaw
desc: Make a robot balance itself on a seesaw
---
The core idea is to demonstrate balancing by a robot. One way to do that with our non-holonomic robots is with a seesaw. The concept is that we create a ramp that is balanced in the middle like a seesaw. The robot drives up the ramp up to the middle and then uses micro motions to remain balanced. Any attempt to throw it off by pushing it or one side of the seesaw is instantly compensated.

Another idea is to remove the caster from one of our robots and still maintain stability.

So more thought is needed around this project. But the high level goal seems quite nice and worth figuring out.
