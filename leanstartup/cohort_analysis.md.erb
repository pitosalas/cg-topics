title: Cohort Analysis
---
#### What is Cohort Analysis?
* Just another tool
* A metrics analysis technique
* Key to avoiding vanity metrics and devloping actionable metrics
* Concept: Look of metrics of separate groups of users or customers
* Surgically measure the impact of changes, pivots: **experiments**

#### Picking the right stages is KEY
* Look at the lifetime a customer and identify key stages
* Make sure the stages can be measured and are associated with a specific user
* Make sure that they are meaninful to the business and the engine of growth
* Measure a baseline with current product
* Changes can now be measured to see if they had desired impact
* Identify key stages of relatioship with customer, e.g. AARRR

##### Step-by-step:
* Decide what "experiment" you want to look at
* Decide what "actions" you want to focus on
* Cohort: all customers who signed up during a certain week (time period)
* Each customer starts and stays forever in one cohort
* Create a generalization of the traditional funnel report
* Note that Cohorts can be non-time based too (e.g. employed vs. unemployed)
* Note that Cohort analysis is usually for the experiment, over a particular time period
