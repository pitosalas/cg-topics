:include_topic :ros_cheatsheet

:h3 Intro

* We are going to use an example from the [ROS By Example Volume 1 Book](http://www.lulu.com/shop/http://www.lulu.com/shop/r-patrick-goebel/ros-by-example-indigo-volume-1/ebook/product-23032353.html)
* Follow the instructions to install the "ROS by example code". Even though it says "indigo" it should work on "kinetics".

:h3 Install ROS by Example Code

:source_begin :bash
cd ~/catkin_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/pirobot/rbx1.git $ cd rbx1
git checkout indigo-devel
cd ~/catkin_ws
catkin_make
source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
rospack profile
:source_end

:h3 Install TB3 Simulation

* Follow these instructions: http://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/simulation/#turtlebot3-fake-node-implementation
* We are going to use the turtlebot3 simulator not the one that the ROS By Example book uses
* Install the simulator
* Make sure TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=burger
* Launch the turtlebot simulator, which also launches Rviz
* Launch the turtlebot3 teleop
* Play with it

:source_begin :bash 
rostopic pub -r 10 /cmd_vel geometry_msgs/Twist '{linear: {x: 0.1, y: 0, z: 0}, angular: {x: 0, y: 0, z: 0}}'
:source_end

:h3 Out and Back using Odometry

* See page 57? of ROS By Example book
* We don't launch tbx1_bringup because we are already running the TB3 fake.
* We don't launch rviz because that is already running
* Run the program odom_out_and_back.py
* Lets look at the code
