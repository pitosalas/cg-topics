## Classes, Objects and Inheritance

* Classes: How do you decide what a class is and what it is not?
  * What is the domain or the problem space or the problem domain?
  * Look for Nouns!
  * Remember SRP: Single Responsibility Principle (see [Single Responsibility Principle](https://blog.8thlight.com/uncle-bob/2014/05/08/SingleReponsibilityPrinciple.html))
  * Ask yourself: "What does this class represent/do?"

## Objects

* Classes and objects are different!
* Instance variables
* Constructor (no destructor in Ruby!)
* Methods: private/public

## Polymorphism

* When the same interface can be used with objects of different classes
  1. Example: In ruby, message #to_s can be sent to objects of different classes
  1. Why is it useful?

* Ways to achieve this:
  1. Inheritance
  1. "Duck" Typing
  1. Delegation

* "Duck" typing.
  1. Don't rely on the class/type of a thing to know what it can do
  1. Reverse it: based on what it can do, you can tell the type of a thing.
  1. How is duck typing is an alternative/complement to inheritance?
  1. And what about Java interfaces?
  1. Consider a method like #talk in a gaming application
