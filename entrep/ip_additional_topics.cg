:slide_title Protecting your IP and respecting others' IP

* Licensing is a contract between two parties where I allow you to 'use' something that I own
* You need to decide what you 'release' and what you don't. For example, do you release source code? Do you release your circuit diagrams, and so on. Whatever you 'release' you have to 'protect'
* Two steps:
  1. First, make it protected, so you own it
  1. Second, grant someone else permission to use it in a controlled way, by licensing it

:slide_title NDA

* Non disclosure agreement
* Entered in before a meeting where you will hear or tell secrets
* Required to preserve "trade secret" status
* FrieNDA
:slide_bigtitle Open Source and Creative Commons

* Both allow you to control the sharing of your IP
* Open Source is a form of license
* [GNU General Public License](http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html)  is the most popular
* [Open Source Initiative](http://opensource.org/licenses) collects and explains all the variations
* [Creative commons](http://creativecommons.org) - a refinement over "all rights reserved"
* Can I make money if I open source my product?
