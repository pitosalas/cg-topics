title: Coffee Assignment
---
<%= partbadge %> **Coffee assignment** You just found out what team you are on. For this assignment I ask that your team get together outside of class for coﬀee (or tea or lunch or caramels). At the meeting, collect everyone's name and contact information and record it somewhere (on your phone maybe).
    * **Goal:** The purpose of this assignment is for you to meet and get to know a few people in your class. This will help both with group work in class and with having someone to work with outside of class.
    * **Why?** There is strong evidence that students who succeed in college-level math classes have social groups formed around academics; in other words, they talk to friends about math outside of class.
    * <%= deliverable "After you meet, each person in your group must post two of the following on LATTE:" %>"
      1. a selﬁe/photo of your group out to coﬀee
      1. your group name (make something up!)
      1. something that everyone in the group has in common
      1. something on which everyone in the group has a diﬀerent opinion (e.g., favorite movie or song)
