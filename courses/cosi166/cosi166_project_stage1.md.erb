## Goals

1. Get organized as a team, get used to each other
1. Decide and nail down your product vision
1. Make basic agreements
1. Get your environments set up
1. Achieve alignment

## What you will learn

1. How to use some key tools like git, GitHub, Trello and more
1. How to operate effectively as a team

## Steps

1. To prepare for your initial meeting  each team member should review <%= link_to_topic :working_in_teams %> for ideas on how to organize your first meeting. Discuss roles and interests and confirm expectations.

1. To help you with ideas (in addition to other class work) you can review <%= link_to_topic :good_166_product %>.

1. Setup a single GitHub repo for our team. Be careful: Create it on GitHub, giving it a name corresponding to your project. Then, clone it onto each team member's computer. Make the repo private and make each team member a collaborator. Go through the trouble of learning what ssh is and setting it up because your life will be much more pleasant.

1. Setup Trello and begin using Kanban to keep track of tasks and commitments. Include the link to your Trello in your readme for your project. Invite Pito and the TAs all to be able to view your Trello. You can use <%= link_to_topic :mini_scrum %> as a guide to how to use Trello.

1. Decide informally as a team what you want to do as the "hello world" version. Typical would be to have a very simple page layout with a title and a single list.

Think about what the most "essential" noun ("thing") is in your product. Is it the students? the professors and courses? the games and characters? the events? It doesn't matter too much at this stage. But that might be the first "models" or "resources" you create? The "Hello World" version might list them, allow you to create one, delete one and so on. You can decide. It should just be pretty minimal.
