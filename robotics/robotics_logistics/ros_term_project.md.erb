title: Autonomous Robotics Term Project
desc: About proposing, running and completing the project
---
## Background
A major part of this course is the design and completion of the Term Project. Students are welcome to come up with their own project ideas and assemble their own teams. This note will go over some of the parameters

## Teams
The team should be a size appropriate to the project at hand. Likely most of the teams will be two students, but there might be one person projects and three person projects. The expectation is that the project writeup explains the need for the proposed number of students. You are welcome to propose your team members. This is just a propsal and we reserve the right to modify it by adding, removing or changing the makeup.
