## How a web server works

* Review of some basic concepts
  1. Client and Server
  1. Client asks for a page; server sends a page
  1. Web server receives the request and creates the page and sends it back

* A level deeper:
  1. Server (usually) looks inside a database for information
  1. And runs an algorithm on that to create the output
  1. And that's what gets sent back.
