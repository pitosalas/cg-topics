title: PRR7,8, Read Paper, PA3 Robot Dance

## 1. PRR Chapters 7,8 <%= partbadge %>

### Purpose

* We continue laying the foundations of learning ROS
* We learn how to use sensors and motors to control the robots basic behaviors
* I realize this is difficult and things don't always just work the way you expect.

### Activities

* Please read these chapters to try to really understand how things work
* Remember to refer to the relevant links of Chapter Supplements as indicated below
* And you really need to try to run some of the examples to see that you are starting to understand
* Respond to the requested warmup questions for each chapter

1. Read Chapter 7 of PRR and remember to refer to <%= link_to_topic :prr_wander_bot %>. Consider the following warmup questions:
    1. As we are talking about sensors, think about this: In the Red Light! Green Light! program what plays the role of a sensor?
    1. This is tricky: the formula on page 104: `bearing = msg.angle_min + i * msg.angle_max / len(msg.ranges)` is incorrect (i.e. it's an error in the book!) What is the correct formula, or what is the error?
    1. In Wander-bot, where is the code that assures that the robot doesn't run into a wall when it is wandering? What line(s).
    1. Please write one or two things that are still confusing to you; if it's all clear, then please write one or two major takeaways.

<%= deliverable "Your responses to the above questions, in brief, as a post to the participation blog" %>

1. Read Chapters 8 of PRR and remember to refer to (<%= link_to_topic :prr_teleop_bot %> Please respond to the following warmup questions:
    1. What features are added to produce key_to_twist_using_rate.py from the previous version, why would that be useful and what line in the program contains the key change?
    1. This will take a little research: on page 114 you see `rospy.Subscriber('keys', String, keys_cb, twist_pub)`. What does each parameter do?
    1. On page 124 you see `./keys_to_twist_with_ramps.py _linear_scale:=0.5 _angular_scale:=1.0 _linear_accel:=1.0 _angular_accel:=1.0`. What does the `:=` notation mean or do?
    1. Please write one or two things that are still confusing to you; if it's all clear, then please write one or two major takeaways.

<%= deliverable "Respond to the questions, and respond to the post in the participation blog" %>

## 2. Read "Real Robots Don't Drive Straight" <%= partbadge %>

The purpose of this is ti really understand and appreciate the importance of learning with a physical robot. It will also give you a perspective on some of the challenges of teaching and learning robotics.
### Activities

Read [Real Robots Don't Drive Straight.](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/Symposia/Spring/2007/SS-07-09/SS07-09-020.pdf). After reading the article try and answer the following warmup questions:

1. In naval navigation there is a term *dead reckoning*. Explains what this means and how it relates if at all to the paper.
1. So why then do real robots not drive straight?
1. Please mention two concepts or topics or ideas that didn't make sense to you and your major take-away(s)

* Please read the instructions and deliverables closely for this assignment: <%= link_to_topic :teleop_plus %>
