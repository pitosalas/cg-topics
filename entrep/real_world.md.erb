## Real World Survival Kit

<slide_break></slide_break>

## Do what you said you would do

* Immediately you are in the top 25% of professionals
* Say what you are going to do, and do what you say
* No one is perfect, sh*t happens, so...
* Underpromising?
* Be willing to make specific (not wishy washy) commitments, including scope and date
* And then do what it takes to deliver - or make sure you let  people know

<slide_break></slide_break>

## Networking
* It's a gift economy
* The personal network you start building now is more powerful than anything else I say
* Who do you know - who knows you?
* It's an ongoing project
* Karma. What you sow is what you reap
* Know why you want to talk; know why you'd be worth talking to
* Book: [Never Eat Alone](https://www.amazon.com/Never-Eat-Alone-Expanded-Updated/dp/0385346654)

* Invest a little in the relationship: jeep in touch with some regularity

* Figure out why you want to talk to them and tell them
* Make sure it's mutually 'useful'

* Less scrutiny on each individual employee

<slide_break></slide_break>
