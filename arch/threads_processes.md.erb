title: Threads and Processes
---
##### Processes and Threads - General
* Key Operating System facility for concurrency
* Processes ("forking")
  * Use more memory (new VM for each process)
    * for the data + the program + everything
    * "Copy on write"
  * If parent dies before children, they can become "zombie" processes
  * Context switching very expensive
  * Communication expensive (IPC or file system)
  * Slower to create and destroy
  * Less hard to program and debug (not easy!)
* Threads
  * Use less memory (Shared memory space)
  * All threads die when oricess dies
  * Context switching cheap
  * Communication cheap (via queues and shared memory)
  * Fast to create and destroy
  * Harder to program and debug
