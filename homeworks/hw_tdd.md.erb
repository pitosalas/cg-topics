title: TDD homework

### General
* Don't use inheritance!
* Test ALL the methods (including initialize if applicable)
* Here's an [example that gives the whole thing away](https://github.com/pitosalas/tdd_demo)
* <%= nb "The concepts are the same, but the syntax of minitest, minitest/spec and rspec are a little different. I strongly recommned minitest/spec" %>

## Instructions
* Develop the following simple program using Test Driven Development
* Meaning, write the tests FIRST and then write the classes
* In other words, for example:
  * Write a test that creates a new Rectangle without actually writing the Rectangle class
  * That will fail, of course. Now, in a separate file, write the minimal amount to make that test pass. That would be a class called Rectangle, with no methods.
  * Now in your test, create a Rectangle, and call a method on it, checking that it returns the right result.
  * That will fail too. Go back to the class, and write the minimal code to make the test pass.
  * Rinse and repeat.
* You may use minitest, minitest/spec or rspec. I recommend minitest/spec.

## Specifics - what you will need
* A class called Point to represent a point on a plane (i.e. x and y coordinates, floats, representing meters from the origin)
* A class called Rectangle that represents a rectangle with two points
	* Rectangle#area (in square meters)
* A class called Triangle that represents a triange with three points.
	* Triangle#area (in square meters)
* A class called Circle that represents a circle by a point and a radius (float)
	* Circle#area (in square meters)
* A class called Scene that represents a scene consisting of one or more rectangles, circles and triangles.
	* Scene#shape_count (how many shapes there are)
	* Scene#total_area (sum of all the areas even if they overlap; don't worry about computing intersections.)
	* Scene#add_shape (adds a shape to the scene)
	* Scene#remove_shape (removes a shape from the scene)

## If you want to go further
 If you want to push yourself add some more methods by writing a test, and then implementing them. For example, Scene#copy_shape, Shape#resize_rectangle, Shape#is_square?, Line.new(point, point), Rectangle(point, point), Line#paralel(Line), are possible ways to go further.
