title: Research to compare different SLAMs
desc: Investigate compaetrative performance of various SLAM algos
---
SLAM is the algorithm which, given sensor input will compute the location of walls, and generate a map file as output. There are multiple SLAM packages and more coming all the time. For example, `gmapping` and `cartographer` but there are others

The project is to compare each of these packages and write an analysis. This is in the form of a research paper. I would start with a litarature search to see if anyone has done this before, and how it was done. Also a search for actual SLAM packages and figure out which ones are viable candidates. Determine what your research questions are. For example: RQ1: Are there a set of useful standard metrics by which to compare SLAM algorithms? RQ2: Given some of the important SLAM algorithms for which there are implementations, can the metrics above be used to compare them?
RQ3: Given the comparisons, what are recommendations that practitioners could use to select the right choice.

Identify their tuning parameters and try to see how they perform in different scenarios. For example a simple maze, a real world hallway, outdoors, different materials or lighting conditions. Whatever makes sense.

From this decide on the dimensions of comparison and how to measure. Then run tests of different SLAM algorithms and report on a comparison and recommendations on when to use each.
