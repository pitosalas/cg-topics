title: "Fiducials for Navigation"
desc: Respond to fiducials and use them for navigation
---
##### Summary

In this assignment we learn how to work with Fiducials to guide navigation. The setting is indoors. There are several fiducials mounted on walls. The fiducials encode identifiers. The Robot is commanded to navigate to the target fiducial by following a trail marked by fiducials.

##### Requirements

* Write a program `fidpath` which takes as parameters an ordered list of fiducial identifiers, e.g. `$ rosrun fidpath 3f 2a 70`
* The program logic is:
    * Spin in place and find a fiducial
    * Navigate to a spot in front of it
    * Rotate in place until you see a fiducial that is "later" in the paratmer list
    * Repeat until you arrive at the fiducial that is last on the list (#70 in the example above)
* If the robot sees for example Fidcial #2a it will not return to #3f if it sees it because it is earlier in the list. Instead it will expect to see #70, navigate to it and stop because it is the last one.

##### Equipment

* TB3 with camera
* several fiducials mounted on walls with known "ids"
* A ROS map is **not** required

##### Skills you will learn and practice:

* Working with Quaternions
* Using Fiducials with robots

##### Content knowledge you will gain:
* 

##### Examples of this in the real world
* supply a link or paper or video)

##### What to hand in
* Zip up your source code
* A video (informal) of the robot executing the code

##### Think through the design
