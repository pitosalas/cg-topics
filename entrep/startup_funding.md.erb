## Startup Funding

* You need money to pay salaries and other expenses
* You don't have revenue, or you don't have enough profit

<slide_break></slide_break>

### Where might money come from?

1. Friends and Family
2. Consulting/Work on the side
3. Angels - Individuals or in groups (e.g. Walnut or Common Angels)
4. Venture Capital - Organized as funds - two sided (e.g. North Bridge or NEA)
5. Incubators/Seed funding companies (e.g. Y-Combinator or TechStars)
6. Crowdfunding (e.g. KickStarter)

### What is a VC firm?

* A "firm" that stands between two constituencies
* Limited Partners (LPs) and Startups

<slide_break></slide_break>

### "Limited Partners"

* Organizations like Universities or pension Plans
* Who need to "manage" a large sum of money
* They allocate portions of their funds to different investment types
* One of the investment types is "venture capital"

<slide_break></slide_break>

### Venture capital as a "investment class"

* Considered high risk and very long term
* Startups and other businesses who need money
* New teams looking to raise capital
* Previously funded teams who need more capital
* Existing companies who are established and need more capital.

### "Value add" of VC firm

* Locating the best investments into a portfolio of investments
* Managing the portfolio companies for best outcome
* Over 7 years goal is
  1. 10% companies are 100+x successes
  1. 40% companies do "ok"
  1. 40% fail outright
* VC pools "Limited Partner" funds into numbered Funds
* Each VC will choose an appropriate size fund.

### What is the process?

* Rounds of investment
* How valuation changes
* Term sheets
* Liquidation preferences will turn your hair grey.
* Founders have an idea - investors have money
* It's a contract between founders and investors

<slide_break></slide_break>

### Valuation

* What is the company worth - what would it cost for me to buy it from you?
* Like any asset, it's a negotiation (like a house)
* It's simple arithmetic but it is confusing
* Pre-money - what is your company worth before the investment?
* Post-money - Note that this is equal to pre-money + amount invested
* [Let's work an example in google sheets](https://docs.google.com/a/brandeis.edu/spreadsheets/d/1e40QxrBat3WOoZ0kMV9Omd6MUius4JUaqSUvIamzILc/edit?usp=sharing)

### Rounds of financing

* What is a round
* How does it end? Liquidity Event
* Seed/Angel, A-Round, B-Round, ... IPO or Acquisition

<slide_break></slide_break>

### What you negotiate over

* Valuation and Investment amount are the key parameters
* How term sheets turn into "deals"
* What's a seed deal?
* Should you or shouldn't you?
* What are VC firms really?
* General and Limited Partners
* Why do people love/hate VCs?
