title: Reflections on Computer Science
---
* **Software Engineering vs Computer Science**: Give this some real thought please:
  * How did my views about myself and my future changed or stayed the same over the course of this semester?
  * How have I changed my views on computer science and software engineers, and what it takes to be one?
  * Do I see a role for myself as an computer scientist, software engineer or entrepreneur in the future?
  * What have I learned about myself as a computer scientist?
  * How have I grown? In what way do I feel better prepared now?
  * In what way have I clarified what I want to do when I graduate?
