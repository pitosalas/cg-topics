title: Mobile App Approaches
---
#### Mobile GUI

##### Criteria for evaluation
* Are both iOS and Android required? How about smaller platforms?
* Is access to hardware necessary? (e.g. GPS, camera, etc)
* Is an Offline or occasionally connected scenario required?
* Is a native look and feel mandatory?
* How much effort/resources/time/money are you able to invest?
* What are the performance and responsiveness requirements?
* How will user discover, install and upgrade the application?

* **Reference:** [Mobility Client Architecture](http://www.tcs.com/SiteCollectionDocuments/White%20Papers/Mobility_Whitepaper_Client-Architecture_1012-1.pdf)

##### Guide to performance goals
* 0.1 Second: Looks and feels instant
* 1.0 Seconds: Maximum before flow is interrupted
* 5 Seconds: Maximum before losing user's attention and focus

* **Reference:** [Response time in man-computer conversational transactions](http://theixdlibrary.com/pdf/Miller1968.pdf)

#### Overview of Approaches
* Mobile web based application
  * Responsive HTML inside Mobile browser (e.g. Safari or Chrome)
  * Plus "turbolinks" and good caching
  * Pros/Cons:
    * Simplest to implement
    * Levarages existing HTML
    * Does not have native look and feel
    * Cannot access hardware of the mobile
    * Cannot be "installed" via the app store
    * Requires continuos connectivity
* Native Mobile App
  * [SWIFT on iOS](https://developer.apple.com/swift/)
  * [Java on Android](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html)
  * Pros/Cons:
    * Most complicated and expensive to implement
    * Hard to share code between platforms
    * Perfectly native user experience
    * Full access to hardware
    * Distribution through app store
* Hybrid App
  * Mobile web app
  * Embedded in a thin native shell application
  * Some of the screens are web and some are native (degree differs)
  * App is installed via stores
  * Leading framework is: [PhoneGap](http://phonegap.com)
  * Pros/Cons
    * Not much more work than mobile web app
    * Solves some of their key weaknesses

#### Enhancing Mobile Web Based Applications

##### What is TurboLinks?
* Rails specific solution
* Fully revamped in Rails 5
* Unlike Rich JS Clients, controllers are sending html to clients
* Fights to preserve state in the browser instead of re-sending it (JS, CSS and even parts of the DOM)
* Pros/Cons
  * Stay in Rails. Far smaller incremenental investment for better web performance
  * On mobile, network delay is typically 300-700ms, so Turbolinks is not going to break the 100ms barrier

#### Rich Client GUI JS Frameworks
* Very hot right now
* Personally not (yet) a super fan
* Awesome results, but very high investment
* Shifting sands
* Web Components: Combining appearance and behavior. Still in flux, e.g. [Component Based Web UI](http://derickbailey.com/2015/08/26/building-a-component-based-web-ui-with-modern-javascript-frameworks/)
* Examples: Ember, React, Angular, BackBone, Aurelia, and many others

#### How they work
* Create a stateful experience in the browser
* Use REST to get and store application state
* Use browser's local data store as needed to achieve disconnected experience
* Data mapping to connect data displayed in a view with data in the model
* Use a REST-like API to access data and state from the server
* In Rails world, use Rails-API

#### In conclusion
* Remember the YAGNI principle
* Make sure you understand your requirements
* Don't invest in an architecture before your users/market demand it
* Be very careful of building on unstable/shifting/marshes!
