desc: Smallest example of a robot navigating indoors, going throug stages of implementation

#### Introduction
This is to extend what you built in the outdoor MVP to the indoor environment. The biggest challenge will be knowing your location.

#### Steps
1. Identify a way to determine location indoors. Consider the following options:
  * Visually: using visual references (e.g. april tags)
  * Wifi: look into wifi position system (WPS)
  * Bluetooth beacons
  * Magnetically (look up indooratlas)
  * RFID tags (will probably have to be used in combination with dead reckoning
  * Motion capture (cameras mounted on the building tracking the robot)
  * Something fun I haven't though of
1. Adapt code to use indoor position instead of GPS
1. Try it out!
