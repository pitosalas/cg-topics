title: Reinforcement Learning
desc: Use RL to discover the most efficient way to traverse a path
---
## Background
The basic idea is to experiment with RL as it applies to guiding a robot safely down a marked path. We don't know a priori whether this will work and whether in fact it will discover the most efficient path but it should be very intersting to experiment with.

## Literature
* There is no doubt literature on this or related experiments.
* Make sure you do a literature review so we at least know what has been done before.
* It is fine to attempt to 'reproduce' a result you find in someone's paper

## Potential Outline
* We can try to do this in a simulator thereby potentially running many tests overnight or more quickly.
* Create a path using red blocks on either side that is perhaps 50 to 75 cm wide and 5-10 meters long. Place the robot at one end and a target at the other end. 
* Start the algorithm running until the battery dies or the robot crosses a finish line.
* The algorithm will set a course somehow, and will be able to detect the starting line, a wall as well as the finish line.
* When encountering a wall presumably or the start line, the robot will turn in some direction and amount and continue.
* The RL algorithm will be taking in a variety of data, e.g. scanner data, odometry data.

## Question
* Is there  a way to do this so that the robot discovers the most efficient way to get from the start line to the finish line?
* What happens if the marked path is not straight but has turns (like a race track?)
* What RL algorithm or approach works best (or at all?)

## Deliverable
* A live demo with an actual robot
* A report
