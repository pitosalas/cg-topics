desc: Learning how to write a good StackOverflow question is an important skill

### Purpose

As I have explained in class many times, trying to be a software engineer without leveraging your peer community out in the world is like working blindfolded with one hand tied behind your back. The purpose of this assignment is to encourage and push you to take your first step. Reinventing the wheel, spending too much time on a small detail that no-one needs to memorize is not a great use of your time, on one hand. And on the other hand, sharing your knowledge and learnings with your peers is a time honored way to make connections and community. 

### Please do this

I would like you to write a question on StackOverflow so that it gets a response. Notice that SO is a technical question and answer site. They don't allow opinions but rather love seeing code in the questions. It can be a question about your project (why is my has many through not working?) or about Ruby (I need to pass a method as a parameter so I am using a lambda but I can't get it to work.) 

### Submit this

A pdf including your name, and the text of your question and the answer you received, including the urls.
