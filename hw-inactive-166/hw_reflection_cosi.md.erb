title: Reflections on Computer Science

1. <%= pdfbadge %> <%= partbadge %> **Reflection Assignment:** *Give this some real thought please:* How did my views about myself and my future changed or stayed the same over the course of this semester? How have I changed my views on computer science and software engineers, and what it takes to be one?  Do I see a role for myself as an computer scientist, software engineer or entrepreneur in the future? What have I learned about myself as a computer scientist? How have I grown? In what way do I feel better prepared now? In what way have I clarified what I want to do when I graduate? Useful context: [What is Computer Science?](http://www.cs.mtu.edu/~john/whatiscs.html) and [Is Computer Science Science?](http://www.cs.mtu.edu/~john/jenning.pdf)
