title: Homework info

#### General
* The homework due for a particular lecture is always listed at the top of the page for that day.
* When there is something to hand in it will be marked as a "deliverable"
* Some homework is designated "Team Deliverable:" which means that a single deliverable is due for the team and all team members get credit for it.

#### Numbering scheme
* Every lecture has a lecture number.
* Deliverables are numbered from 1 to n for each lecture.
* Homeworks are all identified by <<lecture number>>-<<deliverable number>>, so the second deliverable mentioned for lecture 12 would be numbered: 12-2.

#### Handing in Homework
* All homework is handed in in Latte.
* All written papers, posts, reports, etc. must be in PDF format
* It is due before class on that day. Talk to us if that poses a problem.
