title: Forms and Views
---

#### Tour of the sample code
* Reference containing all the code: [Forms_Views_emo](https://github.com/Cosi-166/form_view_demo)
* Feel free to look, but DON'T COPY/PASTE! I trust you otherwise why would I give you the repo?
* Take 10 minutes now to grab the code from github and look around

##### Models
* There are 4 models
  * Item (Has many comments)
  * Category (Has many items)
  * Comment (Belongs to a comment)

##### Routes
* <%= discussion "URLs, HTTP verbs and routes" %>
  * What's a good URL to see all items?
  * What's a good URL for search?
  * What's a good URL for seeing a list of comments? Think again
  * What's a good URL for creating a comment?
  * Let's look at routes.rb and take turns explaining each line

##### Rake Tips
* rake db:migrate:reset
* rake db:seed

##### Let's look: Migrations
* Nothing special going on
* Notice exactlhy ONE per table (at this stage of the game)

##### Let's look: Bootstrap
* Look at [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com)
* Look at [Bootstrap Demo Github](https://github.com/Cosi-105/bootstrap_demo)
* Not using any gems for now!!
* Why is most of the Bootstrap setup in application.html.erb?
* Where else do we see bootstrap?

##### Partials
* the _form.html.erb is a partial (view)
* the same body of the form is used in a new and update scenario
* Incorporate with `render 'partial'`

##### Seed data
* Put enough 'real looking' seed data so you can get a feel for the UI
* seeds.rb is a regular ruby program. Look at sample code.

#### Hacking the sample
* Get formdemo to run on your computer
* Update the new item form so it looks as pretty as the search form
* Update the new item form so it shows a popup of categories instead of a blank
