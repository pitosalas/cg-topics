In this course, you've worked on two different teams, the pilot team and the term project team. What was that experience like for you? Here are some questions to stimulate your thought, you don't need to answer each and every one! How effective were you as a team member? Did you enjoy it? Sometimes people on a team take on different roles by virtue simply of their personality and talents. What role did you take on? Did you like the role? Had you worked in teams before? How was this time different? What did you learn about yourself as part of working on this team? <%= deliverable "Write up your personal reflection on these and related questions. Submit to Latte as a pdf." %> **\[Graded for participation only\]**
