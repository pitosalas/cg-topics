title: Reflection on Presentations
---
* You've now prepared and delivered one or more presentations. I'd like you to reflect on that process.

	How did you approach the preperation? Why did you decide to include what you did, how did you think about that? How did you feel just before you went on? Did you feel well prepared, were you nervous? If you've done more than one for this class, how was the second one different from the one before it?

	Did the presentation go as you hoped? Did anything surprise you? In retrospect, do you feel that it went as well as it could? What do you think you would do differently next time? What would you keep the same? What is the importance of giving presentations to an entrepreneur?
