title: nanoTwitter Validation API
---
* `GET /test/validate?n=n&star=u1&fan=u2
  * Checks for valid processing of the backend
  * The purpose to detect that the nt back end is faithfully storing and retrieving the data
  * This is not necessarily so because a very easy kind of concurrency bug leads to cache mistakes
  * star and fan are existing users user_ids
  * In one request, does the following process
    * Make sure that user `fan` is following user `star` and if not, make it so
    * Have user `star` create `n` tweets using faker.
      * Don't just use Tweet.create; use the code that is actually executed when a user submits a tweet
      * This will invoke whaterver optimizations, follower handling which may include redis, queues, or other optimizations.
    * Store the tweet ids and the content for later. 
    * You can simply use two arrays, one of the faker text for each tweet and one of the resultant id of the tweet
  * Once complete
    * query the backend for those same ids
      * Again dont just use Tweet.find; use the code that is actually executed when displaying a tweet in the ui
      * Similarly, it will use whatever optimizations, redis, queues and so on.
    * query the timeline of `fan` to make sure that the new tweets are listed
      * Again, use the code that is used by the front end not just the low level code.
  * Note: this is not checking HTML it is bypassing that and using the lower level internal methods (you can decide.)
  * Returns 200 or 400
