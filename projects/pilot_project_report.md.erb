#### Pilot Project Report

The Pilot Project Report is a team deliverable. It should be a pdf of 4-6 pages jointly written by the whole team.

##### An excellent report

* Is clear and specific and allows the reader to distinguish your product from all the other ones. It makes a great overall impression: well organized, well written (good English), pleasant to read? It has a logical structure and includes an introduction and a conclusion. Diagrams, images and charts are useful ways to break of the text and make the report easier to digest.

* Includes a have a high level and very concise description of the product. This needs to be catchy but also descriptive. It's surprisingly common for a reader to literally not understand the product. The reader must be able to understand what the product does for them, and something about how it will do that. Sometimes another way to look at this is to have an elevator pitch for the product (see: <%= link_to_topic :elevator_pitch %>). No matter what, there should be a clear description of your product.

* Discusses the hypotheses that were investigated, their types (customer, problem, etc) and state of validaton. It addresses leap of faith hypotheses, and which ones were validated and which ones failed. It should explore the evidence and include some  data from "out of the building" expriments. And it might touch on What tools and techniques were used to validate them, dead ends that were pursued, and a final target list of major product and business features.

* Describes what MVP(s) were built or ought to be built. Explains how and what hypotheses were targetted for each MVP. And also describes the processes by which the MVPs were used to validate the hypotheses. If there were any pivots, this would be where they would be explained

* Addresses the characteristics of the market(s) that your product targets and includes a thoughtful discussion of the growth model (engines of growth.) How will customers find out about it, what ways are there to grow the business?

* Includes a reflection on the experience: How did your team operate? Were there any conflicts? How well did the LS work for you? What challenges did you have to overcome? And do you think this product would work? Could it make money? Would you invest in it?
