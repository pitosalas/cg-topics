title: The Pivot
---

* What's a Pivot? Why do we do a pivot?
* What are the signs that one should be contemplated?
* How is it different from just an adjustment based on a failed hypothesis?
* What's a "leap of faith" hypothesis? Related to "product vision"
* When is it a pivot vs. a simple change to try to respond to feedback?
	* When it's a change to a 'core assumption' ?
	* When it's a change to a 'article of faith' assumption?
* Depending on the reason of the pivot, you will consider ways in which to change plans

:slide_title Iterations vs. Pivots

* Iterations are smaller, incremental changes based on feedback and learning
* These are part of the normal "Build-Measure-Learn" feedback loop that Ries describes.
* Pivots are more significant changes that alter the fundamental hypothesis about the product, strategy, or growth engine.

:slide_title Matter of Degree

* Minor product tweaks, feature adjustments, or small changes in targeting are typically considered iterations, not pivots.
* A pivot involves a more substantial shift in the business model, product direction, or core strategy.

:slide_title Examples to Illustrate

* Iteration: Changing the color of a button based on A/B testing results.
* Pivot: Realizing your photo-sharing app is more valuable as a messaging platform (like Instagram's shift towards Stories and direct messaging).

:slide_title Ries's Perspective:

* Ries emphasizes that pivots are major changes that arise from validated learning. They're not just random ideas or minor adjustments.
* He sees pivots as a way to "zoom out" from day-to-day iteration to reassess the overall direction.

:slide_title Frequency

* Iterations happen frequently, often daily or weekly.
* Pivots are less common, occurring when a startup realizes its current path isn't leading to sustainable growth.

:slide_title Decision-Making

* Iterations are often decided at the team or product management level.
* Pivots usually involve higher-level strategic decisions, often requiring buy-in from founders or executives.
