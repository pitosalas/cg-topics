desc: How to prepare and what is expected

#### Showcase Day Presentations

* The audience will be your classmates and anyone else you want to invite
* You should wear "business casual", no ties or dresses required.
* Whatever you feel comfortable with.
* There will be a panel of Judges to listen and comment on the presentations
* I will determine the order at the last minute
* The Judges will give their feedback and rank the products
* But, your grade will be based on much more than that.
* Given the time you should probably not have more than 10 slides
* Below are a long list of possible topics to give you inspiration.
* You can't use them all! Really! Don't try. It's just to give you ideas.

##### Ideas for slides (in alphabetical order. You should not/cannot include all of them!)
* Customer story or scenario
* Data collected
* Demo of your product or service, including a scenario or story
* Elevator pitch?
* How does our product or service make the pain go away?
* Hypotheses?
* If we had more time?
* Job the product is doing for the customer? How did the customer do it before? How will they do it now?
* Market segment, is it really a segment? Do people here talk to each other? Do they have similar requirements? Can I reach them the same way?
* Mockups and/or prototypes
* MVPs tried? Especially good if 
* One or two sided market? If two sided,how do you expect to reach both of them? In what order?
* Pivots undertaken. This is interesting especially if it demonstrates that you were disciplined in following where the research led you and didn't stick to a plan that didn't work.
* Problem being solved, pain being relieved? In what way is it crucial for the customer? How do we know?
* What is the ONE THING? Demonstrate that you chose one specific problem to solve and really solved it. Show focus.
* What is the product or service? You would be surprised how often it happens that at the end of the presentation the audience looks at each other and say: "I don't understand what the product is!" Keep it simple and clear.
* Who is on the team? Photos? Names? Email Addresses?
