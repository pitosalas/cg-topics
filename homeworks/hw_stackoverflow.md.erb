<%= partbadge %> <%= pdfbadge %> **Stackoverflow:** I would like you to write a question on Stackoverflow so that it gets a response. Notice that SO is a technical question and answer site. They don't allow opinions but rather love seeing code in the questions. It can be a question about your project (why is my has many through not working?) or about Ruby (I need to pass a method as a parameter so I am using a lambda but I can't get it to work.) <%= deliverable "A pdf with the text of your question and the answer you received, including the urls." %>
