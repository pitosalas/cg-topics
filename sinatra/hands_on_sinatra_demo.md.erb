## Hands On Demo

This introductory demo script uses source code from **sinatra_first_project**, which you can find in my [sinatra_examples](https://github.com/pitosalas/sinatra_examples) repo. You should copy it step by step if you really want to learn!

### Steps
* Ruby 3.0.3
* Directories
  * Create directory myapp/ in a convenient spot and `cd` to it
  * Set that directory up as a git repo: `git init`
* Make sure you have the Sinatra gem installed
* Create the simplest possible sinatra app and run it with ruby

:source_begin :ruby
require 'sinatra'

get '/' do
  '&lt;h1>Hello world&lt;/h1>!'
end
:source_end

* Create a gemfile, bundle, and run the program
* Install Postgres: [Detailed Installation Guides](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Detailed_installation_guides)
* Update app.rb to full example

* Add model directory, 
  * And model.rb
* Create config directory
  * database.yml tells activerecord where and how the databases are
  * Indicate the modes and the database names
* Add db directory
  * Take a look at schema.rb
  * create migration in migrate folder
  * rake db:migrate
* Run the program
  * Error, no erb!
* Create views directory
  * Add index.erb with a form in it.
  * Form will allow user to enter data
  * But entering a new model gives an error
  * Now add a another view called models.erb
* Show that we have a list of models now
* Success!
