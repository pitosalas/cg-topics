title: Hardware and Software Configuration
---
Students report consistently that the hardest and most frustrating part of this class is to get the hardware and software working correclty and reliably. We have experimented a lot to streamline this procedure. 

For this class, you will need the following setup. 

## Running VMWare:

* Mac, Windows or Linux
* 8Gig or more of RAM, 
* Solid State internal Disk (SSD)
* At least 30Gig disk free
* no older than 2 years

### Otherwise
If you don't have such a computer, then we will loan you a Solid State Disk that you can boot from. A little less convenient but more reliable and will work on just about any computer

## Operating System
* Ubuntu 18.04
* ROS Melodic
