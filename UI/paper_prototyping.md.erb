title: Paper Prototyping

#### Paper Prototyping
* There are many media for doing this.
* Here are lots of examples of [paper prototyping here](http://www.google.com/search?q=paper+prototyping&hl=en&safe=off&client=safari&rls=en&prmd=imvnsb&tbm=isch&tbo=u&source=univ&sa=X&ei=slDNT5TgBIW16AHc293MAg&ved=0CGYQsAQ&biw=1251&bih=840)

* Advantages
	* Very cheap which saves money
	* But also makes it less painful when it has to be changed totally
	* Allows a user to take over and cross things out and suggest other ideas
* You can take this as far as you want.
	* Smaller snippets for the various ui widgets (e.g. drop down menus)
	* Make a "screen flow diagram" by connecting the different sheets of paper with lines showing the transitions
	* It is similar to a movie 'storyboard'

##### Here is my example: not good UI.
