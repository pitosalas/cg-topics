## 1. Read and do PRR Chapter 12  <%= partbadge %>

* Yes we are skipping Chapter 11 for now. Chapter 12 will teach you a few new concepts that will be very helpful in completing the line follower assignment below. Make sure you do this part first!
* Some of you have just been reading and not "doing" the code examples in the chapters. This is to your detriment. You know I always say that most of the learning only happens when you are hands-on in the code! Also remember to use the chapter supplements that O've provided in <%= link_to_topic :prr_follow_bot %>. With that, answer the following questions about basic robotic perception using Follow Bot:
    1. What is OpenCv exactly? Don't quote Google or the book. In your own words. 3 sentences more or less.
