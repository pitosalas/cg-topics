### How the course will work

Classes will be conducted over Zoom. All students are expected to attend with their cameras on throughout the formal class time. Also team work and customer interviews and discussions will be conducted using Zoom. We will make extensive use of breakout rooms in zoom to allow for small group work.

Team work has always been essential to getting anything real done. And with Covid now more than ever, organizations are encouraging or even requiring remote work. And in most cases remote team members are not self-selected, they are chosen based on organizational requirements. And so in this course also, remote team work will fundamental to success. 

All students will be placed into teams of 4 very early in the semester and will work with this group throughtout. We will do our best to create reasonably matcehd teams but you will also have to understand the reality of not being able to handpick your teammates.
