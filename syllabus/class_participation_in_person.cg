title: Participation in in-person classes
---
Attendance is required for in-person classes such as this one. We will be taking attendance. However if you have a reason why you cannot participate in person, you are welcome to ask to be excused. We will be very flexible. All classes will be streamed and recorded so that you have various options if that situation arises.
