### Clients and Servers

* Both are computers, depends on their purpose
* Networking's purpose is to get 'data' from one to the other
* .... even when they are on the other side of the world

### Take a look at

<%= code_begin %>
$ ping brandeis.edu
$ traceroute brandeis.edu
<%= code_end %>

### Basic Terms

* **Host**: On the internet, a computer that is part of the network is often referred to as a `host`
* **MAC address**: A totally unique number assigned at time of manufacture to every piece of hardware that can be connected to the network. Media Access Control address. It "cannot" be changed.
* **IP Address**: Internet Protocol Address, e.g. 12.44.23.123
* **Domain name**: A name assigned to a host on the internet, e.g. brandeis.edu
* **DNS:** Domain Name System. An internet-wide service (a distributed database) that associates ip addresses to domain names

### MAC addresses, IP addresses and DNS

* User types in a domain name
* Target computer is identified by an IP address
* So: Need a phonebook of some kind
* DNS: distributed name service

### Basic Network utility programs

* ping: sends a message to a destination host and listens that the packet is sent back
* traceroute: similar, but records the intervening hosts
* ifconfig: list network interfaces and what IP address they are associated with
* netstat: A really verbose printout of all the local TCP/IP ports and whats going on
* nslookup: Look up the ip address of a domain name
* whois: lookup what the internet knows about the owner of a certain domain name

### More about IP

* So the IP address is for 1 specific 'host' or server (as usual there are exceptions :)
* IP is the way servers talk 'to each other' to get a packet of bits between them
* Conceptually, 'send these bits to this ip address'
* What's a port number
* TCP/IP: what it means
