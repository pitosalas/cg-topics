title: Rails "tasks" (commands)
desc: List of the most common Rake tasks
---
* Reminder: rake is a command line utility that is used to automate a variety of small tasks that ruby and rails developers have to do all the time. (For your history buff, the name is derived from the old C utility called "make" -- "ruby make" -> "rake")
* Reminder: As of Rails 5, you can use `rails` as the prefix instead of `rake`

##### Getting a list of Rake "tasks"
* rake -T 				# to get a list of all the more typical rake tasks
* rake -T -A        # show every single task

#### Primary db related tasks
* db:migrate runs migrations for the current env that have not run yet
* db:create creates the database for the current env
* db:seed (only) runs the db/seed.rb file
* db:setup runs db:schema:load, db:seed
* db:reset runs db:drop db:setup
* db:migrate:reset runs db:drop db:create db:migrate

##### Secondary db related tasks
* db:create:all creates the databases for all envs
* db:drop drops the database for the current env
* db:drop:all drops the databases for all envs
* db:migrate:up runs one specific migration
* db:migrate:down rolls back one specific migration
* db:migrate:status shows current migration status
* db:migrate:rollback rolls back the last migration
* db:forward advances the current schema version to the next one
* db:schema:load loads the schema into the current env's database
* db:schema:dump dumps the current env's schema (and seems to create the db as well)
