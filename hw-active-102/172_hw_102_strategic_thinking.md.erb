title: HW on Strategic Thinking for the Entrepreneur
---
### Purpose

* An entrepreneur has to learn to think strategically, analytically and carefully
* In order to evaluate what to do, how to do it, and what to do next.
* This is another form of critical thinking
* This is a first, individual practice
* We will do more of this and practice it in class too

### Steps

1. Read [4 Ways to improve your strategic thinking skills](https://hbr.org/2016/12/4-ways-to-improve-your-strategic-thinking-skills) and [Strategic Leadership: The Essential Skills](https://hbr.org/2013/01/strategic-leadership-the-esssential-skills)
1. Now with that background read [Delivery Startups are Back like it's 1999](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/24/magazine/delivery-start-ups-are-back-like-its-1999.html) and as you read, think about the idea of a delivery startup on campus and these questions:
    * What might be some of the advantages of targeting college students? 
    * What are characteristics of them as a customer base which would make it hard for a Fedex or amazon to deliver to them? 
    * What are some of their needs which might be different and hard to meet by a general business? 
    * How would you test some of these questions and assumptions?
    * What kinds of products might be amenable?
    * Is there a way to capitalize on the slowness of the mail room?
    * What products, services, customers, campuses, geographies, and any other characteristics might be relevant? 
    * Is this a worthwhile idea to pursue?
