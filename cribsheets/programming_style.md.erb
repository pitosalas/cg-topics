## Good Programming Style Checklist

* Like good writing style, good programming style is important, subtle, nuanced, and often a matter of opinion
* Yet over the years we have learned many fundamental guidelines and rules which most everyone agrees makes for good style.
* While that might make interesting and valuable reading, here I give my own much briefer set of rules of thumb.

### Conventions

* Each language has conventions about how to do certain things.
  1. What case to use for identifiers
  1. What order to put things in a source file
  1. How to structure a package and so on
* You need to be aware of them and follow them.

### Idiomatic Code

* It is also useful to become familiar with so-called "idiomatic" code.
* Most languages have more than one way to do something, all valid
* Programmers experienced in the language always pick one over the other.

### Short Methods

* Try hard not to exceed about 15 lines in a method.
* If it feels like you can't make it shorter, look for a set of statements in the method which do some sub-step and break them into another method.

### Short Classes

* A corollary of the previous is to try and keep your classes to 100 lines or less.
* This one might be more difficult to follow because often its a matter of design.
* With the right abstractions and classes and seeing how a class is doing more than one job.
* You will get get better as you get more practice.

### DRY

* DRY is a software engineering slogan meaning "Do Not Repeat Yourself".
* It means, in the simplest sense, no textual duplication of lines of code.
* If you find yourself cutting and pasting some lines of code from one place to another, your code is not DRY.
* This is an opportunity to create a new method, with a good name, and call it from both the places.
* In a more advanced sense it means that you should not duplicate concepts or knowledge.

### Intention Revealing Names

* You have to make up names for variables, methods, classes, packages, parameters, files and more.
* Whether the name you pick is "good" is kind of a matter of taste
* An excellent guideline is to use a name which describes what the thing represents

### Whitespace

* Most programming languages (python is a notable exception) totally ignore whitespace.
* You can put in extra spaces, tabs and newlines just about anywhere without changing what the program does.
* But you can hugely change how readable it is.
*. Indentation should match the nesting structure of your program.
*. There should be an empty line before and after each method definition.

### Commenting

* Don't comment too much or too little. Ok that's not so helpful.
* But really you should add comments only when the code doesn't speak for itself.
* If the method is called "returnLargestInt" then don't add a comment that says, this method returns the largest integer.
* But if it uses an interesting algorithm to do this, or it has error cases or other unusual behavior, that that might deserve an comment.
