title: Mocking
---
### Overview
* SUT ("System under test")
* Collaborators (other objects needed to test SUT)
* Decoupling is a major goal

### What is a Mock?
* An object that stands in for another object during testing
* Make sure that only the right methods are called
* Related terms: Test Doubles, stubs, and others. Don't get confused.
* More distinctions
	* Broadest term: Test Double. They are all part of this category
	* Test Dummy: An object that stands in for another, that has no methods. Not very useful.
	* Stub: Responds to the key methods that are required for the test but the return values are fixed.
	* Spy: Like a Stub, except it "remembers" what calls were made so it can verify that the expected calls were indeed made.

### Advantages and Disadvantages
* Decoupling is always a good thing.
	* Performance
	* Maintainability
	* Testability
* If you introduce a bug in a class
	* Only the tests that are testing that class will fail
	* So, fewer false positives
* Disadvantages
	* Need to maintain to consistency between the mock and the class-being-mocked
	* Otherwise you may be testing somethingn that doesn't even exist
* Real world example:
	* Let's look at some of the code that runs this web site.
	* Note slightly different syntax because of RSpec vs. minitest/spec
	* [citem_spec.rb](https://github.com/pitosalas/coursegen/blob/master/spec/citem_spec.rb)
	* [toc_spec.rb](https://github.com/pitosalas/coursegen/blob/master/spec/toc_spec.rb)
