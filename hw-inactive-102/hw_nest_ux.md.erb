title: NEST UX Homework
---
* Study and read up on the [Nest Thremostat](http://nest.com/thermostat/life-with-nest-thermostat/). The purpose of this homework is for you to practice applying what we have been learning about user experience to a product that you don't know yet.

	Look for articles describing the user interface of the device and play with the demos on their site. You will find videos that describe the installation and the use of the NEST. You might also find articles that either complain or compliment the user interface of the NEST. What do you think they have done right, and what have they not done great? Make sure you refer back to the UX principles we've talked about or that you can find on the web. Don't just list the features or that you think the NEST is cool, but be specific: "There are no affordances to explain to the user that they have to twist the ring" as an example (although I don't know if that is or isn't a fair point :)

	<%= deliverable "Write a post giving your assessment of the Nest User Experience. What is good and what might be better in their user experience, and what do you base your opinion on?" %>
