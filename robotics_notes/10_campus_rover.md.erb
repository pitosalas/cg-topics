#### Grand Vision

<blockquote class="pretty">Campus Rover will be able to deliver a small package between any two offices on the Brandeis campus, as long as there is an accessible route between the two offices. It will be able to navigate autonomously between the offices, down corridors, and between floors, going outdoors if needed.</blockquote>

#### Reality

This is a very difficult goal which we will not reach in the first, second or third semester of this course. Some of the very difficult parts of this are:

* Building a complete map of the campus that includes all the offices, obstacles and so on.
* Dealing with non-fixed obstacles, like, people
* Navigating outdoors, where there are no barriers to guide navigation
* Navigating outdoors, where distance measuring sensors (like lasers, ultrasonic or IR) all have a hard time due to sunlight
* Going up and down between floors - using elevators?

And those are just the ones we can think of so far. Most likely those are the easy difficult parts.
