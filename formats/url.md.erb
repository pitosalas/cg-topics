title: URL - Uniform Resource Locator
---

:h3 URL

* Everyone look at urls of different web sites and see what patterns you detect
* Discuss what people have found

:slide_title Fundamental importance of the URI/URL

* URI = "Uniform Resource Identifier"
  1. Used to be called "Universal Resource Locator" (URL)
  1. Because the resources were files on the disk of the server
* And the URL's path was really a path!
* Focus now on the 'path' part of the URI
* e.g. some ugly examples
  1. `http://roomscheduler.com/reserve/room/3`
  1. `http://bookstore/gonewiththewind/order/3`
  1. `http://nyt.com/latest-updates?year=2014`
* e.g. some good examples
  1. `http://roomscheduler.com/room/3/request`
  1. `http://bookstore.com/book/412/price`
  1. `http://tourmanager.com/city/boston/tour/tuesday/new`
* There are many ways to structure a url

:slide_title RESTful style of URI design

* "Representational State Transfer" (See [Original REST Paper](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm))
* Each URI denotes a specific 'resource'
  1. 'room 3' or 'book 412' or 'Tuesday tours IN Boston city'
  1. It is usually not a file but something generated 'on the fly'
  1. Still the same URI should yield the same resource every time (hand-wave)
* Each URI is used in combination with an HTTP "method"
  1. Get: retrieve the indicated "resource"
  1. Put: update value of the indicated resource
  1. Delete: delete the indicated resource
  1. Post: Create a new instance of indicated resource
  1. (some other, less important ones)

:slide_title One of the earliest design questions

* What do the URLs for my app look like?
* Conceptually, they are "directory structure-like" URLs
* There is a coherent "syntax" about them, e.g.
  1. `http://www.myservice.org/discussion/topics/{topic}`
  1. `http://www.myservice.org/discussion/2008/12/10/{topic}`
  1. `http://www.myservice.org/discussion/{year}/{day}/{month}/{topic}`
