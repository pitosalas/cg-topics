title: Talking to a real life entrepreneur
---

I would like you to interview a real entrepreneur that founded a company. Not just anyone who says that they are an entrepreneur but someone who actually is in the founding team. I prefer it to be face to face, but telephone is also acceptable. And you can't just send them these questions and submit their answers. I want to see some back and forth. 

### Who to talk to?

Many of you might know family members or acquaintances who are founders or know people who know. I want you to ask your family members and you will often find someone who started a company or project. It doesn't have to be a tech startup. If they had to take a risk to pursue something big that they believed in, they are an entrepreneur. Remember This would include for example, starting a dog shelter, opening a restaurant, championing a new line of cosmetics, and so on and so on. 

If after trying you cannot identify a good subject that talk to me and I have a list of possible people to talk to.

### Purpose and outcomes

The purpose of this assignment is to give you a chance to learn and practice some important skills and also gain insights to what it means to be an entrepreneur, which can be very different for different people and businesses. You will have a chance to improve on your professional communication, how to organize an interview, how to think about what questions to ask and follow ups, and then how to reflect and summarize what you have learned.

I hope you will gain insights from this specific entrepreneur, what the challenges are, what the personal and professional traits are that are important. You will be able to reflect on your own strenghths and challenges in terms of entrepreneurship that you will have to work on. You will also gain a sense of the great rewards (not just financial) that come with entrepreneurship. 

Previous students who have done this assignment often report that they had unique conversations with parents or relatives or friends where they learned things that they never knew and could admire abou tthem.

### Guide
Here's a rough guide to the tasks

* Ask around among your friends and family for someone who self-identifies as an entrepreneur or entrepreneurial. This is far broader than a "silicon valley startup" person. Someone who started a business, retail or service; someone who founded a non profit or foundation; someone who created a successful organization or club. It's broad. If you are not able to identify someone talk to Pito and I will help you with some names. But you will find it much more interesting if you have a personal connection with the person.
* Develop draft interview questions. Look at my suggested questions but add your own based on what you know of the person. Look at the "Goals" section below for what you should be trying to learn. Just emailing my suggested questions to the person is not sufficient.
* Make an appointment for the phone or zoom call. Make it at the convenience of the subject, and let them know what to expect. How long a conversation and the kinds of questions you want to ask. 
* Before the call, see what you can learn about the subject's experiences. What was the company or technology or service, etc. If you know something about this you will be more comfortable and more credible during the call. 
* After the call write a 1 to 2 page summary of what you learned. See the deliverable below

### Suggested questions

Try to get answers to questions such as these (use your own words):

* What was your first job after your education, and at what point did you know that you wanted to be an entrepreneur? Also, how did you go from wanting to be an entrepreneur to actually starting the company?
* How did the company develop? How was it successful, how was it not successful? What did you personally do in each scenario?
* Have you started other companies, and how did they go in comparison?
* What are some of the personal traits, talents, skills or knowledge, that have served you well as a founder? What is the mistake you feel is made often in founding a company?

### Deliverable

Write a 1 or 2 page summary report or article about your interview. Try to distill out some lessons. Include a section with your own personal reflection on: what it means to be an entrepreneur, and how you yourself see your entrepreneurship, and what you personally learned and got out of the interview. Submit as a pdf.
