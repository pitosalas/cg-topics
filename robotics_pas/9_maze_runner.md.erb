title: "PA: Maze Runner"
desc: "Robot finds its way out of a maze"
---
## Summary

A maze is provided built out of the red blocks. The robot is placed somewhere in the middle of the maze and it drives, following walls, identifying corners, to eventually find its way out of the maze. All the corners in the maze are 90 degrees, and there are no loops. The whole maze will be approximately 3x3 meters, and the passageways will be approximately 0.5-0.75 meters.

Write a python script to control a robot running a maze. From anywhere in the maze, the robot needs to find a way out, that is to the exit. You will know the exit because there are no obstacles within 1 meter in all directions. 

"Challenge by Choice": You may find that the /odom topic has some useful information to help solve this problem. Odometery is not required to solve this problem, but it could lead to a more robust solution if used correctly. 

You should write and test your code first on the simulator. This command will give you a pretty nice "built-in" sort-of-maze using Gazebo

Remember to try to work in the simulator first. If your code works well in the simulator you know that your algorithm and logic are right. However, even though it works perfectly in the simulator, it might encounter unexpected problems in the real world. The physical robot will behave a lot differently than the simulated one. Take that into account.

The wall-following algorithm can be the basis of the solution, but it is not the only one. And even if you use that, going around corners or handling dead ends will need special attention. But you are encouraged to try different algorithms. You can find tons of algorithms online. Feel free to use any of them. You can invent your own algorithm as well.

You are free to refer to hints for inspiration, and are encouraged to experiment with novel ideas.

## Assignment

* Your team is responsible for creating mazes in simulation/lab at home to test your ROS program
* However we will grade all of the teams assignments on the same set of mazes
* It will be up to your team to decide to how split up the work
* Please start development early so you still have time for testing

### Deliverables

* Team members submit the same:
    * The source code, including a readme explaining what it is, how to run it and any other reflections. This should be a nice ROS package directory structure as before.
    * A video of the real robot running the maze successfully. This can be totally rough, unedited, with crazy laughing in the background. We just want to see that it worked.
* Each teammember submits their own:
    * Design note + personal reflection: topics such as: Problems you had in getting the program to work; What more you would do if you had more time; how working with a teammate felt; how effective it was

## Tasks

1. Make sure you have read or looked at Chapters 1-7 of the book, or gotten the same background through your means
1. Study Lessons 1-4 of [Udacity AI for Robotics Course article](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/cs373/lessons/48684821). Studying means actually doing the exercises and quizzes. Lessons 1 and 2 will give you a great intuitive and conceptual understanding of localization. Chapter 4 will teach you about Kalman filters. This is worth your time, you will learn a lot!
1. write the maze_runner.py
1. write a launch file for your program
1. build a maze in gazebo
1. test the algorithm in the virtual maze
1. test it on the actual robot
1. Write the initial code (using Python) to start listening to the messages that the similator robot sensors are publishing.
1. Figure out how to use that data (which is 360 degrees of distance data) to determine what the walls are the robot is confronting
1. Use what you learned in the previous Maze assignent to implement a similar or identical algorithm, this time using LIDAR data
1. Implement the complete Maze Solver and demonstrate it working in the simulator
1. Learn how to deploy your code to a real TB3 and experiment a little
1. Adapt your code (if necessary) to work as well in the live robot
1. Demonstrate!

### The Maze
There is a maze already set up next to the lab for you to practice on. You can change it if you want, but it doesnt need to be too complex.
Each team can create their own maze as long as it is simuilarly complex as the one in this diagram. 
  
**NOTE**: When creating a maze, make sure that all of the walls are connected and has no cycles. If you were to draw your maze, you should be able to draw all lines without lifting your pen (you can trace over lines twice). This is important if you choose a wall following algorithm - the robot might get stuck in circles going around a disconnected wall!

### Process
This is a pair programming assignment. You've been assigned a teammate. It's fine to talk to everyone else, as well as google for ideas. Just  as long as the code is written and fully understood by both members of the team. You will submit one solution for each team (see below.)

Since this project requires collaberation, you may wish to start using Github to share code. Is it your first time using Git and Github? [Try this extremely basic guide to using Github](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) [And this is a handy guide to Git terminal commands](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/)

### Hints

* You will **not** be using SLAM for this project. Instead you will use the Lidar to return to you distances to the next obstacle at different bearings. That way you can sense walls left, right and in front of you.
* Notice that you will be writing and testing this algorithm in simulation mode with Gazebo. That stands for 
* Once you have the algorithm working, we will go to the next big step which is to actually run on a physical robot!
* As you write code, please try to think about good programming habits and designs. Your code may start as a bunch of spaghetti but by the time you hand it in we are expecting something with reasonable modularity, abstractions, single responsibility principle etc.
* beware of invalid data from the lidar. the lidar on our robots has particular limitations: The specs say that minimum distance is 120 mm (12 cm, about 5 inches) and maximum distance is 3.5 meters.
* Break the problem down into smaller parts. Think about situations that robot may find itself in, and how it should behave given that circumstance.
* Wall following is tricky because depending on how you do it, it might oscilate back and forth. Read up about PID below, it has some good but advanced ideas.
* Note that as you are following a wall, you need to notice when the wall suddenly disappears and at that point you have to turn to keep following it.
* Conversely the robot might be in the middle where all walls are far and as far from it, in which case you have to just drive until you get to the wall and then start following it
* Feel free to google for wall following robot and be inspired by what you read. Do not copy the code, please.
* Here are some solutions that might be helpful, but please do not limit to these.
  
### Wall Following Algorithms
For this assignment, you can choose to modify your wall following algorithm from the previous assignment to run the maze. Keep in mind the width of the corridor when you make your adjustment. Some of the places which the algorithm might struggle can be: corners, dead-ends and invalid lidar reading when the robot is too close to the wall.

* One of the most successful approach from the students of previous years is the 'longest distance algorithm', which looks for the longest unobstructed distance using the lidar and solve the maze by repeatedly finding and moving to the location where the distance between the robot and the location is the longest.

* Your very own Algorithm: What other approach will you come up with? Don't be afraid to explore unchartered territory!

### Working with LaserScan data
Here is a great video which provides almost everything you need to understand to manipulate the LaserScan data: [Reading Laserscan Data](http://www.theconstructsim.com/read-laserscan-data/) The most important field that you need to understand is the `ranges`. You can access the reading of a specific angle by using `range[index]`, and access a subarray by using `range[index0:index1]`

An infinite LIDAR value in a gazebo similation is inf (infinity), while that on the actual Turtlebot3 is 0. A 0 reading from Turltebot3 can refer to either infinity or actual 0 (obstacle is right next to Turtlebot3). Check the valid ranges and also remember that the Lidar's range is not infinite!

###  PID Control
PID is a well known technique for smoothing out control, to avoid oscilation. Applying PID control to your algorithm will make it more robust and perform more consistently. PID control is a smoothing function which helps you better follow the wall without too much fluctuation. It will make the robot turn at a higher speed when you are too away from the designated route (too far or too close to the wall), and turn at a slower speed when you are close to it.

Here are some great links. You will be amazed at how well this works.
