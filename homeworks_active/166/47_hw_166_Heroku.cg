## Heroku scaffolding

:topic_include :heroku

We will be using Heroku throughout. This tutorial will take you through the mechanics of creating a template or scaffolding application for heroku. Heroku requires that you use the Postgres database (and not mysql)

Follow [this comprehensive tutorial](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-rails6) After following this tutorial you will have an app thatâ€™s up and running! Be sure to fully understand RORT chapters 1 & 2 before you follow this abridged tutorial.

You will use this work when you embark on PA Rails #1 next week.
