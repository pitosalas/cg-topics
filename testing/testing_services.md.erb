title: Testing Services
---
#### Background
* Service testing is key when building a Service Oriented Architecure
* It is exactly analogous to End-to-end testing or integration testing
* It supplements basics of Unit Testing
* It's an extension of testing in general
* Concurrent software is the most difficult kind to reason about

##### Internal vs. External API
* We are focused here on *internal" service APIs
* Since you control that the considerations are different
* External APIS - Web APIs provided to you by another company altogether
  * You don't control it. The response time may vary dramatically from test to test
  * You might need tokens or log ins. There may be quotas (maximum number of calls)
  * The service may not be free
  * You need to make sure that your code behaves correctly no matter what that service does
  * You cannot fix bugs in the service, all you can do is respond in a safe way
  * Here's a good article discussing a classic scenario and a typical conceuptual approach. In this example it is using a well known Ruby tool: [Learn How to Test Third Party Services With Minitest & VCR](https://blog.eduonix.com/web-programming-tutorials/learn-test-third-party-services-minitest-vcr/)

##### How Services are put together
* By definition what makes it a service is that is accessed over HTTP
* The functionality is nvoked via a URL (or queue -- for later) 
* And it produces results by returning JSON (or XML -- for later)
* We happen to be using Sinatra for dispatching HTTP routes and returning JSON

##### Unit Testing Services
* Keep the app server aspect (e.g. `sinatra`) as thin as possible
* Create your functionality from POROs ()
