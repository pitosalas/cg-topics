### Basics

* Homeworks are assigned weekly (see <%= link_to_section :intro, :weeks %>) and are always due Monday at 11:50pm
* When there is something to hand in it will be marked as a "deliverable" or "Team Deliverable" which means that a single deliverable is due for the team and all team members get the same mark for it.#

### Your responsibility

* All homework is handed in in Latte. If for some reason there is nowhere in Latte to submit it, email me right away to check.
* All written reports, reflections, responses should be submitted as **PDF** and must include your name, team name if appropriate, and course number in the text of the submission.
* Code and other non-text submissions can be submitted as-is or as a .zip file

### Automatic deductions

* Late homework is deducted 10 points within 3 days, zero otherwise.
* Missing homework is scored at zero
* When submitting homework to Latte (other than participation blog) it must be in .pdf form (20 point penalty) and it must have your name, homework name and team name (if appropriate) at the top (another 20 point penalty)
* No exceptions unless pre-agreed in an email by either the Professor or a TA.
