### SOA and REST and Services

#### What is a web service?

* Consider this web page: [Olin College Engineering Courses](http://www.olin.edu/course-listing/)
* What would  [schdl.net](https://brandeis.schdl.net/term/Spring_2018) di if it wanted to have a list of courses pre-populated with a college's courses?
  * Grab all the text `curl http://olin.smartcatalogiq.com/en/2017-18/Catalog/Courses-Credits-Hours/ENGR-Engineering > olincourses.txt`
  * Write a program to parse that page and then load the results into a database.
  * This is called "scraping" and usually that would violate a copyright
* Server can also deliver information in "machine readable" formats (such as JSON or XML)
* The term "API" is used to describe the permissable ways that one program can call another, such as a library
* Web Service API is when this is between servers on the internet

##### Protocols
* This can be done with many different standards and formats and protocols
  * SOAP: [Simple Object Access Protocol](http://wikis.olin.edu/coursecatalog/doku.php?id=course_listings:engr)
  * XMLRPC: [XML-RPC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML-RPC)
  * REST: [Representational State Transfer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) -- our focus

<%= discussion "What are some of the big differences between calling a gem's API and calling a web service API?. Performance? Error handling and recovery? Security? Cost sharing?" %>

##### Pause to look at the big picture
* Servers on the internet, anywhere, can be called as objects and methods
* Resources of all kinds can be offered to clients with no coordination
* The internet becomes a huge, amazing Operating System

#### One level deeper

##### RPC - Remote Procedure Calls
* Imagine a procedure (method): get_horoscope(date, sign) => String, so for example: `get_horoscope("march 22, 2015", "aries")` which returns a sentence of text (not html!)
  * I could use it to improve my calendar app to optionally display the user's horoscope
  * Or, I could use it to create a twitter "robot" to answer a tweet with my horosc
* What would it mean to call it between two computers?
* What would it mean to call it between two computers over the internet?
* How would you approach it?
* REST - A different way to think about RPC

##### REST based on HTTP: Mini review
* HTTP Verbs: GET (HEAD), PUT, POST, DELETE.
* Think of everything in terms of a 'resource' that is being manipulated
* For example, GET means get a representation of the resource marked, e.g.
  * GET http://www.facebook.com/user/pitosalas
  * GET http://www.facebok.com/users
  * GET 0.0.0.0:3000/cards/1.xml
* Some things are harder to fit with the model
  * What might a fortunecookie service look like as REST?
  * The 'resource' here is a single fortune
  * http://myfortunes.org/fortune/1
  * http://myfortunes.org/fortune
  * http://myfortunes.org/fortune/random
  * http://myfortunes.org/fortune?about=money

* Note fortunes/random, random is not exactly identifying a resource; but close enough.
* What if caching was done strictly by url?
  * Two advantages:
    * some rhyme or reason on how to build urls and
    * make logical use of url space
    * Different 'representations' possible: html and xml, but others too, say csv or video
    * Big one: Standards allow caching in the cloud. But what about 'random' case? TTL!

#### Let's play with it!
* Here's the web site for [Fortunes](https://rpsfortune.herokuapp.com)
* Here's the code for it [Fortunes Source code](https://github.com/pitosalas/restapidemo)
