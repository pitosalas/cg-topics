title: Agile Methodology
---
## How a tech company works nowadays
* Classic roles and how they apply in a software company
	* Marketing
	* Sales
	* Engineering (Dev, QA, Devops)
	* Finance
	* Business Development
* The role of a 'schedule'
	* Why is it important?
	* How is it used?
* <%= discussion "When things change...." %>
	* How are some of the ways that things can change?
	* What can cause those changes

## Waterfall and Agile
* **Waterfall**: Distinct stages, e.g. design, architecture, implementation, testing, deployment
* **Agile**: Iterative, small batches, constant reprioritization.

*Note that both these terms are high level models under which there are many variations*

## Agile in the real world

* Project management/Software engineering
* Methodology? Many variants.
* Agile variants: Extreme Programming, Scrum, Kanban, and many other variants, new ones every day.
* Other methodologies: waterfall. "BDUF".

## General techniques

* **Small teams**: Small, empowered, cross functional teams (scrum teams)
* **Measure**: Don't estimate -- measure velocity
* **Iterations/Sprints**: Work in fixed units of time (time-boxing)
* **Stories**: Describe what is to be built in small bite-size pieces
* **Prioritization:** Constant reprioritization (sprint planning meeting)
* **Daily Standup meetings**: Practice radical transparency and no-blame culture. See [Daily Scrum Meeting](https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/scrum/daily-scrum)
