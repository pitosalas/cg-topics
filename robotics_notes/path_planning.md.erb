title: Path Planning
---
#### Path Planning Conceptual overview

* Given an 'outside' command, make a robotic device move to a known destination
    * Robotic device: could be a land-based robot, a arial robot, a robot arm
    * Really: Any component which can be moved from one location to another location
    * Do this reliably under a variety of conditions

* Do this safely
    * Avoid "prohibited" states
    * Might be: contact with a wall, with itself, with an unknown obstacle
    * Avoid prohibited motions
    * Might be a maximum speed

* Do this efficiently
    * Some notion of cost that is minimized
    * Time, power consumption

##### Prerequisites - some or all
* We need coordinate systems within which to place the device and  obstacles
* We need maps to show where the device can and cannot go
* We need localization so that the robot can know where it is at any point
* We need sensors to detect obstacles which may not be on the map
* We need a way to propel and steer the device

##### Maps

* A set of locations
* A set of connections between adjacent locations
* A "cost" to get from one location to the next
* Information to allow navigating (driving) from one location to the next

##### Topological Representation

* Very simple network diagram
* Well known how to search and analyze it
* Could be useful for path planning
* Works out in a scenario like a subway or road network
* On the surface not so good for an open field of navigation

##### metric representation

* Precise coordinates
* But takes up much more storage
* Typical datastructure is an "occupancy map" 

##### Creating the maps
* Often a map will be known (i.e. a floorplan)
* Sometimes a map can be built by the robot (SLAM)
* SLAM creates a "metric" representation

##### Localization Theory
* Global
    * Location with respect to the world (coordinate system)
    * Example: GPS or WiFi hotspots
    * Can be quite inaccurate

* Local
    * Location with rspect to sensor feedback
    * Can be highly accurate

* Note the role of filters such as Kalman filter to refine noisy sensor data

#### ROS Navigation Stack

##### Path Planning

* Using a topological Representation
* Network search can find the best path through the network
* You are optimizing relative to some parameter - distance, time, risk, etc.

##### ROS Navigation Stack

* 2D navigation
* Inputs
  * Odometry
  * Sensor Data
  * Goal Pose
  * Map
* Output
  * "Safe" velocity command

* Limitations
  * Only for differential drive or holonomic wheeled robots
  * Requires a Lidar (or at least a node publishing /scan topics)
  * Needs a square or circular robot (base)

##### Key Node: move_base
* Implements a ROS action (recall they are for longer term tasks)
* Uses a global and local planner
* Highly modular allowing different implementation and algorithms.

**MOVE_BASE Architecture**

<img src="http://wiki.ros.org/move_base?action=AttachFile&do=get&target=overview.png" style="width:800px">

* Move_base implements action: Go from whereever you are now to this goal
* Inputs into the move_base node
  * map_server: if present delivers the geometry of the map. What is clear, obstructed, inpassible, or unknown
  * sensor sources: Lidar gives information about nearby obstacles in the real world
  * odometry: Gives information about "dead reconning" prediction of robot's location
  * amcl: Gives information about localization based on amcl

  
* Outputs:
  * base_controller: cmd_vel topic published
* Behavior:
  * Attempt to go to the requested destination within user-specified tollerance
  * Do optimal path planning, recompute the plan constantly
  * Engage in recovery behaviors
