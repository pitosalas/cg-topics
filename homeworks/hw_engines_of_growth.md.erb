title: Engines of growth activity
---

## Work together in groups: Purpose

* Team collaboration always build effectiveness
* By thinking about these questions you will get a better understanding of your product or service
* And may see things to change and improve that have nothing to do with growth
* Get the team thinking carefully about their product and how they will get it to build up in numbers of users

### Activities
 
* We break out into teams
* Discuss all the ways in which you might achieve growth in your product or service
* Come up with a primary and secondary engine of growth
* Consider how you would get from 0 to 100, 100 to 1,000, 1,000 to 10,000
* Would you use the same engine of growth (which is fine but not required)

### Deliverable 

1. Describe your product in a very few sentences
1. Indicate what engine of grown would be appropriate at different stages of growth, in particular the first 100, the next 900 and the next 9000.
1. If you want to do some research (google or books), try to be very specific about how you would implement and measure your success at each stage.
1. Submit as a 1-2 page pdf, one per team
