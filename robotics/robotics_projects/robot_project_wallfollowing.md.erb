title: Advanced Maze Solver
desc: Create a really robust maze solver
---
Solving a Maze is "easy" to do in a simplistic manner. But it is really hard to do in a robust way. This project is to create a Maze solver that:

* Has the robot moving smoothly and smartly along straight walls and corners
* Deals with all kinds of corners (not just 90 degrees)
* Possibly uses machine learning to improve its behaviors
* Basically looks to the observer as if a person is steering the robot
* Optionally deals with cycles (how? I am not sure)
