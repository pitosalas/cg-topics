title: Working in teams
---
These notes are based on experience with student run teams. I have seen them succeed and have seen them struggle. Remember, you are not trying to become best friends with your teammates.  You are trying to get something done!

#### Norms
* One of the big challenges is to find time to meet, so try to be flexible.
* As a team, choose a fixed time and place to meet every week. Be flexible.
* Your first meeting is very important.
* Each member honestly say what your personal goals are for this course:
	* This course is my most important, I really care and will do anything to be successful
	* Or, I have a heavy courseload, I will do what I can but I have to balance
	* Or, I am perfectly happy with a "B", don't expect intensity from me.
* If everyone knows each other's perspective this will set expectations
* Each member of the team is responsible for their own work and for the welbeing of the team
* Talk about how you will make decisions:
	* Democratic vote
	* Decide or chose a leader to have final say
	* Divide up the domain (front end/back end/ etc) and assign it to people.

#### Technical
* Create a github repository for all your code from the very start
* Create a Trello project to keep track of tasks and assignments
* Create a Google Drive for documents (specs etc.)
* Partition the work as much as you can to allow each person a bit of independence

#### Conflict
* Working in teams can suddenly become CHALLENGING
* There is a non-zero probability that you will not get along with someone in your team
* Be ready for this and take it in stride. "Whoops, there it is!"
* You are not married, you are not best friends, you are just working on this project, now
* Don't try to resolve the conflict in email, it never works!
