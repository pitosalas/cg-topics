1. <%= partbadge %> <%= pdfbadge %>. **Read** There are several ways to make sure that your work is not stolen or copied. They each have certain benefits and costs. As an entrepreneur it's important to understand each of them. These readings are a good place to start: [What are Copyrights?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright), [What are Trade Secrets?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_secret), [What are Patents?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patents).  I will be asking for definitions and distinctions! Now, think about and respondn to these warmup questions:
  * In the show [Silicon Valley](http://www.hbo.com/silicon-valley), the team from [Pied Piper](http://www.piedpiper.com) has perfected a new compression algorithm which works far more effectively than what came before. Should they employ Trade Secrets, Patents, Copyrights to protect their invention? Explain your reasoning. If you think they would use a combination, then explain how and why.
  * Can you envision a scenario where you use both Patent and Trade Secret protection to protect the same product? Explain your response.
  * What 1 or 2 important things from the reading did you not understand? And if you understood it all, then what 1 or 2 important things were most insightful/useful/valuable to you. Please make sure I can tell which is which!
