:h2 Mockups and Prototypes

* Is there a difference between a mockup and prototype?
* It's a classic MVP testing one ore more hypotheses
* Therefore the amount of "fidelity" depends on what the hypotheses are
* Pick the approach that is the cheapest way to check those hypotheses
* Only create one when the cheaper or more important hypotheses have been tested
