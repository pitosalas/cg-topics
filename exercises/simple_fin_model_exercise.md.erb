title: Financial Model Exercise

## Common sense practice

### Objective

* Using just common sense, think about how you would analyze a specific example. It's ok if you have to tweak some details or skip some assumptions.

### Scenario

* Company "Merch Machine" -- basically a marketing company
* All sales are through a web site (e-commerce)
* Manufactures and sells t-shirts and similar merchandise
* You can decide what the selling price of the t-shirt is
* They think that about $1.00 in marketing expense will sell another t-shirt
* You might think that a cheaper t-shirt will sell more per advertising dollar
* All manufacture and shipping is outsourced
* Each t-shirt costs $7 to manufacture and ship; with more volume the manufacturer will give discounts
* The company Employs 3 people initially. Realize that the more customers you have the more people you might need. You might decide that they should have more or fewer people

### What to do

* Work this out in a google sheet
* Write a summary analysis of your model
* Can you show that you have a profitable business
* Can you show some key assumptions you have to make?

### Hints about building the model

* Months should be along the top (as column headers) - 2 years
* The scenario above mentions many factors and assumptions. Some of those become row headers along the left (e.g. revenue from selling t-shirts) others become constants(e.g. price of a t-shirt)
* It's a good practice to separate out constants with which you might want to do what-if experiments
* Think about how you can write a formula, for example, to compute revenue from the number of shirts sold x the price of a shirt
* Think about how you can write a formula for the monthly expense on salaries
* Think about how you can calculate how many t-shirts I sell this month based on how many I sold last month (the growth rate)
* Think about what other factors might affect the growth rate
* Think about whether you can spend money this month to make you sell more t-shirts next month
* Determine each month how much you either make (profit) or lose.
* Have a line item called "Bank Account" which begins at for example $100,000
* And then goes up or down each month so you can see whether you run out of money

### Submit

* Your summary analysis, a link to your google sheet
* The responses to the questions
