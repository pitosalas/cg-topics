title: (HW) Talking to a real life entrepreneur
---
1. <%= partbadge %> **Talking to real life entrepreneurs.** I would like you to interview a real entrepreneur that founded a company. Not just anyone who says that they are an entrepreneur but someone who actually is in the founding team. I prefer it to be face to face, but telephone or email is also acceptable. Many of you might know family members or aquantances who are founders or know people who know. You can also ask me and/or use LinkedIn.

    Try to get answers to questions such as these (use your own words):

    * What was your first job after your education, and at what point did you know that you wanted to be an entrepreneur? Also, how did you go from wanting to be an entrepreneur to actually starting the company?
    * How did the company develop? How was it successful, how was it not successful? What did you personally do in each scenario?
    * Have you started other companies, and how did they go in comparison?
    * What are some of the personal traits, talents, skills or knowledge, that have served you well as a founder? What is the mistake you feel is made often in founding a company?

    * <%= deliverable "Write a 1-2 page report on your interview. Try to distill out some lessons. Include a section with your own personal reflection on: what it means to be an entrepreneur, and how you yourself see your entrepreneurship, and what you personally learned and got out of the interview. Submit as a pdf." %>
