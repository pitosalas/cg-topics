title: Check environments, do series of tutorials, work on homework
due: February 5, 2021
---
## Plan for today

* This lab will be a guided independent programming session. Please do the following during lab while we are around to help everyone solve their problems.
* This is brand new so we don't know yet how much time it will take
* When you complete each section, ask a TA to come over so you can discuss what you achieved 


### Environment

* Check out your environments by using your cloud vscode:
  * Cloud desktop: http://vnc.yourbrandeisname.ros.campusrover.org
  * Cloud VSCode: http://code.yourbrandeisname.ros.campusrover.org
  
* Use the vscode based shell to create a new directory
* Write a trivial python program in it. 
* Show that you can run the python program from the vscode terminal shell
* Now launch your cloud desktop, open a shell there
* Use the nano editor to edit your program, add a <%= link_to_topic :shebang_line %>
* Change the file mode to allow execution
* Execute it from the command line
