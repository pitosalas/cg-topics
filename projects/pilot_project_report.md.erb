##### Tips
* Try to be clear and specific, allow the reader to be able to distinguish your product from all the other ones.
* Pay attention to the overall impression that your paper makes.
  * Is it well organized?
  * Is it well written (good English)?
  * Is it pleasant to read? Does it follow a logical structure?
  * Is there an Introduction and a conclusion?
* It is often helpful if you can have some diagrams or images or tables or charts. They break up the text and make the report easier to digest.
* Below are the key items of info you should include in the report. You don't need to follow that as an outline, just make sure you touch on those points. The questions I ask in each bullet are not meant to be answered point by point, just to help you think more broadly about the topic.

##### Key information for the report
* Tweet: Twitter length description of the product. This needs to be catchy but also descriptive. Ideally I should be able to tell something about what the product does for me and something about how it will do that.
* Elevator pitch for the product (see: <%= link_to_topic :elevator_pitch %>)
* Description: Describe your product clearly and understandibly. Include a list of top features.
* Target Market: What are the characteristics of the market(s) that your product targets?
* Engine of Growth: What are some of the ways in which this can grow? Which of the types of engine of growth do you think would work.
* Hypotheses: List your hypotheses. What type of hypothesis? (customer, problem, etc.) Any leap of faith? Which ones did you validate and which ones failed? By what evidence?
* Getting out of the building: What tools and techniques did you use, what were the results? Which ones would you still like to validate? What dead ends did you pursue?
* MVP: What MVP(s) did you create or would you create. How did you or would you use it to validate the hypotheses?
* Pivots: Did you pivot during the pilot project? What other pivots do you anticipate and why? How would you handle them?
* Reflect on the experience: How did your team operate? Were there any conflicts? How well did the LS work for you? What challenges did you have to overcome?
* Conclusions: Do you think this product would work? Could it make money? Would you invest in it?
