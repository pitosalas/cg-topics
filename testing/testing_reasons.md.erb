##### Arguments for Automated Testing

###### Credit: Some of this is directly quoting [POODR](http://www.poodr.com)

* Testing and Agile
	* Notion of a 'release' is gone
	* Notion of a 'spec' is gone
	* Cycles are much faster
	* Automation becomes a requirement
* Testing and Design
	* TDD supports design
	* Insist on looking at the class/module/unit first as a black box that delivers services
	* Good design delays all decisions that can be delayed until further requirements are nailed down.
	* Refactoring is how new requirements are incorporated
	* Good test suites is what gives you the confidence to refactor
* Testing and Refactoring:
	* Recall: *Refactoring is a controlled technique for improving the design of an existing code base. Its essence is applying a series of small behavior-preserving transformations, each of which 'too small to be worth doing'*
	* So you always should have solid tests before you start refactoring
	* Each small change is verified to not have changed behavior

##### Good Testing/Quality/Testability
* Fundamental motivation for testing: reduce costs
	* Writing tests should over the lifetime of the code cost less
	* Otherwise it's not worth doing
	* How does it reduce costs?
* Breaking it down: Why Test?
	* Finding bugs early
	* Reducing errors
	* Making assumptions explicit - documenting code with code \[how do test do that?\]
	* Make refactoring possible and safe \[how safe?\]
	* Driving design decisions (TDD?)
	* Discover bad design decisions \[how?\]
* Philosophy of Commenting
	* Believe or not, it's controversial
	* Comments should not duplicate what the code clearly says
	* Of course, "clearly says" is in the eyes of the beholder
	* One philosophy: If you feel the need to put in a block comment, extract that section into a method with an intention revealing name
