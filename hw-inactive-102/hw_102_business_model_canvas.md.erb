  * This assignment REQUIRES coordination among the team. Believe me, it works better and quicker if you do it together face to face.
  * Watch the video and download and look at the [Business Model Canvas Poster](https://canvanizer.com/downloads/business_model_canvas_poster.pdf). Try to understand really what is meant by the term **business model**. As a team, discuss and brainstorm about how that applies to your product. Think about what a business built around it would work. Osterwalter and his colleagues organize the business model space into nine **building blocks** which suggest a series of questions to think about in each block and start seeing the relationships between them. Make notes during the discussion.
  * Divide up the work of doing a writeup between the team members by splitting the Business Model Canvas 'building blocks' among your team. There are nine such blocks on the poster. **Each team member must do some more web research on the Osterwalter's Business Model Canvas to supplement the small summary in the video**. Together or separately discuss and brainstorm what goes into each block.
  * <%= team_deliverable "Once the individual work has been completed, please combine them into one team deliverable, giving a mini-response to each of the \"blocks\". Also include some comments about the discussion itself and how it went. Submit this as a pdf." %>
