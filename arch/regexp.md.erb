* Text pattern matching
* Used many places
	* Ruby:  (`1.methods.map(&:to_s).grep(/.*sp.*/)`)
	* Shell: (`find . -regex .*st[^/]*`)
	* ... all over the place
* [Rubular](www.rubular.com). [See:](http://regex.sketchengine.co.uk)
* Puzzle -- Write a regex that will 
	* match: pit, spot, spate, slap two, respite
	* but reject: pt, Pot, peat, part
* Puzzle -- Write a single regex that matches all of these
	* `<xml>`
	* `<opentag>`
	* `<closetag>`
	* `</closetag>`
	* `<with attribute=”77”>`
* Regexp for a valid email address is: `\b[A-Z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z]{2,4}\b`
	* Let's try and test it and find flaws in it
	* And interpret it
