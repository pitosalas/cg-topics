title: Model View Controller - review
---
:image :600, :mvc_detailed

* Basic Client <-> Server structure
* MVC is a general pattern
* Here we are applying it to a web (http) **server**
* The Models: contains the application 'state'
  * Think of it as what you want preserved if your app (i.e. the server in our case) has to be restarted
  * Think of your user's reasonable expectations
  * Discussion
* The Controllers: master control switch
  * Sees requests from the outside world
  * Asks the models for data, sometimes updates the data
  * Asks the views for new pages or results
  * Responds to the request
  * (Note: this parallels the HTTP protocol exactly!)
* The Views
  * Use data (given by the controller)
  * To create and assemble responses to be sent
  * Responses are html, but may be other formats too
