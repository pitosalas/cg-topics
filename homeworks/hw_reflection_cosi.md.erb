title: Reflection on Computer Science
section: topics
---
* I would like you to think back about your expectations and hopes about this course before you took it and what you know now. Write up a retrospective blog post thinking about questions such as: To what extent has it lived up to them? How do you feel you've changed your views on computer science and software engineers, and what it takes to be one? Do you see a role for yourself as an software engineer or entrepreneur in the future? How has your thinking and approach about starting something brand new changed? What have I learned about myself as a computer scientist? How have I grown? In what way do I feel better prepared now? In what way have I clarified what I want to do when I graduate? <%= deliverable "Write up your reflection as a post." %>
