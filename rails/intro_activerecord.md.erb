### Introduction to ActiveRecord programming

#### Basics

* An [ORM Framework](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/OrmHate.html)
* Reference: [Active Record Basics Guide](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_basics.html)

* What are Models? Very important to understand this!
* Jobs that AR does
  * Representations for models and their data
  * Representation of associations / relationships between models
  * Declarative validations of models
  * Abstraction over SQL, provides excellent optimization of SQL
  * Performance by caching, optimization

#### Conventions
* Naming Conventions
  * Models
  * Tables
  * Records
  * Column names
* Schema conventions
  * Primary keys are always integers called "id"
  * Foreign keys are always called <other table>_id
  * Several other standard column names: created_at, updated_at, type, etc.

#### Magic
* Sequence of events when database is opened
* Automatic creation of "attributes" based on column names

#### Migrations
* Rails programmer utility
* Automates the updating of schemas as the application evolves
* Source of confusion often

#### Examples

##### Models and databases
<%= ruby_begin %>
# Assume Database table was called products and that it had a column called name

class Product < ApplicationRecord
  validates :name, presence: true
end

# Access the database
# Create a new valid record
p = Product.new
p.name = "Some Book"
p.save!
puts p.name # "Some Book"

# Try to create a new record, invalid:
p = Product.new
p.save! # => ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid: Validation failed: Name can't be blank
<%= ruby_end %>
