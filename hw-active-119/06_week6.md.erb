:h2 1. Read this seminal paper in Robotics :pdfbadge

Reading seminal papers in Robotics provides a great and broader view of robotics beyond engineering. In general practicing how to read academic papers helps you find and read the best ones. This particular paper was and continues to be very influential in considering how to control the behavior of robots. For this assignment, read: [Brooks - Robust Layered Control System for a Mobile Robot](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/A-robust-layered-control-system-for-a-mobile-robot-Brooks/dc66c15a005dd1a3a9f033769e7fbc3b943be188).

1. Highlight parts that are especially interesting or difficult to understand.
1. Consider how this approach might have been used in a more advanced version of your Roomba script.

:deliverable What is important in this paper for you? What is the key message? Can you make a connection between it and your roomba algorithm? Think about a maze solving robot or a wall following robot. Are there any ways in which this paper might apply? Submit in a pdf

:h2 2. Term Project Proposals :partbadge :pdfbadge

* This is a team project
* It can be done with a physical robot, with simulation and in other ways that I can introduce
* We will be brainstorming in class for ideas
* This assignment is for you to research and writeup two different project ideas.
* The writeup should be 1-2 paragraphs, and include a name and your name plus proposed team mate(s) if any

:deliverable Your Term project proposal as pdf

:h2 3. Read Chapter 9 of PRR :partbadge :pdfbadge

* As usual, read and do the examples in Chapter 9. The chapter supplement can be found here: <%= link_to_topic :prr_building_maps %>
* Make sure you experiment with rqt_plot, that you run a Map Server, and that you try running the navigation stack. Respond to the following warmup questions:
    1. Exactly what does this code do: `rate = rospy.Rate(10)`
    1. What does `rqt_plot` do and why would you use it?
    1. Precisely what does a Map Server do?
    1. Examine what is in a rosbag file. What is in it

:deliverable Respond to the questions, and submit in a pdf
