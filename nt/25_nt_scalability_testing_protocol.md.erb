#### Scalability Testing Protocol

Here's how testing of scaling will be done with loader.io. You need to make sure that your version of nanoTwitter performs as well as possible in these scenarios!

##### Setup

Before we can run a standardized test, we want to get each server to a known state we do the following commands directly from a browser.

* `/test/reset/all` - Delete everything and recreate testuser
* `/test/reset/standard?tweets=4000&users=1000&follows=2000` - Load the test seed data
* `/test/user/testuser/tweets?count=10` - have testuser tweet 10 times, random text
* `/test/status` - See that the state is what you expect

#### Test Runs
* During the test "someone" may try to log in by hand to make sure things are running ok


##### Maintain Client Load
1. `/` - user tries to simply load up the home page (non-logged in) with 500
1. `/` - user tries to simply load up the home page (non-logged in) with 1000
1. `/` - user tries to simply load up the home page (non-logged in) with 2000
1. `/` - user tries to simply load up the home page (non-logged in) with 3000
1. `/user/testuser` (GET) - display test users - with 500
1. `/user/testuser` (GET) - display test users - with 1000
1. `/user/testuser` (GET) - display test users - with 2000
1. `/user/testuser` (GET) - display test users - with 3000

##### Clients per test
1. `/user/testuser/tweet` (POST) - have testuser create one tweet with 500

#### Data Collected
* Ave response time
* Worse response time
* NUmber of timeouts
* Number of successes
