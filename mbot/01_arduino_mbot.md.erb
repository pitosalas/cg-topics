title: Arduinos and mBots
desc: What is an Arduino? How does it relate to the mBot? What are all the kinds of Arduinos that exist?

## Families of computers
* Common threads
  * Large user community
  * Relatively cheap
  * Large set of add-on hardware and software
* Microcontroler or Microprocessor
  * Usually means a single chip
  * SOC - System On Chip
  * Some of the key chips are
    * ARM architecture (cellphone quality chip)
    * AtMel Chip (lower power, cheaper)
    * MSP430 (Super low power)
* Microcomputers
  * Boards, e.g. Arduino, Raspbery Pi
* Arduino Family
  * Most well known family of microcomputers
  * Used in automation, art, hobby etc
  * Some people say they are a bit dated?
  * Models
    * Uno
    * Mega
    * Nano
    * Due
  * All have compatible layout but different degree of resources
  * Shields
    * General term in Arduino land for add-on boards
* BeagleBone Family
  * More Powerful
  * Can run Linux
  * Less Rich community
  * Models
    * Regular
    * Blue
    * Black
  * Capes
    * General term for add-on boards
  * [BeagleBone](http://beagleboard.org/bone)
* Raspberry PI Family
  * Can run Linux
  * Models
    * Original, Zero
  * [Raspberry Pi Family](https://socialcompare.com/en/comparison/raspberrypi-models-comparison)
* mBed
  * Claim to fame: Web based IDE
  * More of a software platform
  * Huge compatabiloty with boards from different vendors
  * [mBed](https://os.mbed.com/platforms/)

## Arduino
* What's on it
* What are pins
  * Are numbered, e.g. from 1 to 20
  * Vary from model to model
  * Analog "pins"
    * read a range from e.g. 0-255
    * Used e.g. for motor speed
  * Digital "pins"
    * set/read 0 or 1
    * Used e.g. for turn on LED
  * Notes
    * Generally you need to know the pins to use
    * And a library provided by device/sensor/motor handles "encoding"
    * To output analog data, digital pins are used, with PWM
    * PWM = "Pulse Width Modulation"
  * New devices
    * Have to be connected to "the right pin"
    * Documentation will specify
* How can I fry it?
  * Never connect a device to your arduino at all
  * Unless you have verified documentation of how exactly to connect it
  * "Measure Twice, Cut once"
  * Have another pair of eyes check
  * Otherwise: SMOKE!

## mBot Component
* "MCore" board, which is essentiall an Arduino Uno plus the following:
  * dual motor controller
  * two serial RGB LEDs (WS2812 aka "NeoPixels")
  * piezo buzzer
  * light sensor
  * IR LED
  * IR receiver
  * button
  * header block for either a bluetooth or 2.4GHz radio
  * four RJ25 connectors for external peripherals
    * Correspond to some combination of pins
  * [Details about MCore](http://blog.hmpg.net/2016/04/makeblock-mcore-information.html)
* MBot itself has
  * MCore Board
  * Chassis
  * Wheels
  * Motor
