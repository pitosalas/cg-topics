#### User Stories
* Start a list (Trello, Google Sheet etc.)
* Each story is a minimal "feature" or "scenario" or "use case"
* We will give you feedback on the wording
* Keep the list in priority order
* Not unusual to have 50-100 stories
* You will not implement all of them
* Examples from P2PTours
	* *"App can be used without an account"*
	* *"Users without account can search for tourguides"*
	* *"User can request an account by supplying email and password"*
	* *"User receives email with link to confirm account"*
	* *"Registered user can request to be accepted as a tour guide"*
	* *"Request for tour guide is accompanied by a cell phone number"*
	* *"There is a web based administrative console"*
	* *"Requests for tour guide status appear in a queue on the admin console"*
	* *"Admin console requires a login to access"*
	* etc.
