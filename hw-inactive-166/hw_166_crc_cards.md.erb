title: CRC Cards Exercise
---
Study [A library for OO thinking](http://c2.com/doc/oopsla89/paper.html). Consider a system to manage a small school's registration system. There are students, faculty, courses, registrations, semesters and so on. Consider the functionality in your design. Obviously, Students need to be able to register for courses, not all courses are taught every semester, each course is taught by one or more faculty. Design a set of CRC cards for that system. Make sure the cards are legible! They will be graded according to how good or reasonable a design they represent. If they can't be read, then we can't determine that. Include a text commentary to supplement the images.

<%= deliverable "Take digital photos of your CRC cards, make sure they are legible, put them into a file with any commentary needed, and export to pdf. Submit it." %>
