* The presentations should be prepared for 20-30 minutes and figure another 15 minutes for questions
* There will be two "assigned" papers on a related topic
* Using the references or google, students choose a third article that is related
* The presentations will not be exhaustive summaries of the papers, but cover key themes, insights, "whats new and different"
* Students are expected to have read the papers as well
