:h3 Introduction to Topics

* Nodes talk to each other with Topics
* A node can "publish" a topic
* Another node can "subscribe" to a topic
  * The two nodes don't know about each other
  * A node can subscribe to a topic that no one is publishing
  * Two nodes can publish the same topic with no one subscribing
  * etc. etc. etc.

* What is being published and subscribed?
  * messages
  * A message is a data structure with named and typed fields
  * A collection of messages already exists, e.g. Int32, which is message with one element, a 32 bit integer.

:slide_title Some details

* Queues
  * When you define your node as a Publisher you need to supply a queue_size
  * Messages that are published are kept in the queue until all subscribers have received them
  * Therefore if you publish at a rate faster than all the subscribers are processing, you will loose topics
  * A good starting queue_size is 10

* Latched Topics
  * New subscribers to a latched topic automatically get the last published message for that topic
  * Useful for topics which change rarely

:slide_title Publishing to a Topic

* You will find all the book's examples in the [prrexamples github package](https://github.com/campusrover/prrexamples)
* Use the ones in our GitHub because they have been tested with TB3
* If it's not there yet, clone it in your ~/catkin_ws/src directory
* See `~/catkin_ws/src/prrexamples/src/topic_publisher.py`
  * Remember:
  * to do the necessary code generation and compilation you must run `catkin_make`
  * to run `roscore` in another terminal
* Run it and examine that it is publishing as expected, as follows:

:source_begin :language-bash
$ roscd prrexamples
$ chmod +x src/topic_publisher.py
$ rosrun prrexamples topic_publisher.py
$ rostopic list
$ rostopic echo counter -n 5
:source_end

:slide_title Checking That Everything Works as Expected

* Make sure you can see that topics are being published (see `rostopic`)
* Make sure you can see that topics are being subscribed (see console output)
* Try running `rqt_graph` to see the publisher/subscriber relationships for node and topics

:slide_title Subscribing to a Topic

* See `$ ~/catkin_ws/src/prrexamples/scripts/topic_subscriber.py`
* It defines and runs a node whch subscribes to the counter, and prints it

:source_begin :language-bash
# shell commands
$ roscd prrexamples
$ chmod +x scripts/topic_subscriber.py
$ rosrun prrexamples topic_subscriber.py
:source_end
