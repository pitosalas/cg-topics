#### Mutual Respect

Here are some things about me as a teacher that might be interesting and useful for you to know. I think it might make it easier to understand how I respond and why I say some of the things I say.

* **I care a lot about maturity and 'professionalism.'** I work hard (really) at this and I expect you to do the same. We treat each other with respect not because I am the teacher and you are the student, but because we value the effort that each other is bringing to the experience. No one is forcing either of us to be here.

* **I care a lot about-follow up.** If I say I will do something and I don't do it, I feel bad. I expect the same from you. If I make a specific request in person or email, I expect a timely response. Even if the response is that you can't meet the request. Leaving me hanging is not good, I will remember and grumpily ask for it again.

* **I care a lot about teaching.** It's an art that I am still mastering and am very committed to. I put a lot of work into organizing a course, preparing for an individual class, and working with students. I feel proud and successful when students tell me that a course or class or experience was valuable for them in their own lives or carreers.

* **It's important to me to feel like you are serious and engaged and trying** This is not the only course you are taking. You have many other obligations and pressures. You have to triage your time all the time. That's understood. However what makes me sad is to see or feel that a student for whatever reason is nt seriously trying their best, that they don't give a 'hoot'.

* **I am very available to you.** Maybe more than you realize. My email is pitosalas@brandeis.edu and you will get a response very quickly. You also have my personal cell phone number. If you are ever unsure about anything, please ask: in person, or over email. I hope no one is ever nervous or unhappy because they don't feel they understand what is going on, what is expected from them or some material.

* **There are a lot of ways that I can help you.** Please take advantage of them. I can help you understand stuff, decide what matters to learn, how to plan your work, I know a lot of people in a lot of disciplines who want to help students like you. Don't miss the opportunity.
