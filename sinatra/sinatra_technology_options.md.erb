* Improved sometimes, made worse sometimes
* New alternatives are invented
* Totally new approaches are invented

* Understand the tradeoffs
* Decide what is worth learning and what is just [cargo culting](https://skepticalagile.com/cargo-cult-agile-23340e0647ae)
* Learn how to critically analyze your needs and the tradeoffs.
