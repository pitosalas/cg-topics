#### Description
* A metaphor for a brief, engaging description of your product or service
* Literally what you would say if you ran into the President in an elevator
* Or at a conference when networking

#### Example
Here's an example elevator pitch. Please critique it:

*“Let's face it. Parking can be a real nightmare. It can be infuriating to find, extremely pricey and by the time you find that spot you would have lost time, petrol, and caused a lot of unnecessary traffic and pollution. Well, there's an answer, parkatmyhouse.com. We are an awesome little company, backed by an awesome big company called BMW. Now, listen in: You can reserve parking in a private property and save up to 70%. Need to park at a sports match or local station? Sorted. ... Just go to parkatmyhouse.com and simply type in where you want to park and what dates. It is that simple.”*

#### Tips for elevator pitches
* You should have it at the tip of your toungue so when you run into the president you can answer the question: "So, what's your business do?" in a clear, interesting, catchy, provocative manner.
* Purpose of an elevator pitch is to sell you and your idea
* To get the listener to say, "hmm, let's sit down so you can tell me more."
* An elevator pitch is meant to be spoken or read to a potential investor or board member
* Put yourself in the listeners shoes, really! Imagine that they say, "So What?" in response to each of your lines
* If there's a very obvious objection, respond to it right away.
* Hook them with the first words out of your mouth.

#### What to say
* Brief: About 30 seconds
* Persuasive: Get listener to say "tell me more!"
* Practice: So you're always ready
* Audience: Responsive to your audience: is it a colleague, a possible job opportunity, are you trying to recruit someone?
* Listener context: Dont make assumptions about the listened
* Jargon: Avoid it
* Proof points: If you have them

#### Good examples
* *“I work on nanotechnology to deliver medical therapies to targeted cells”*
* *“We are using the manufacturing techniques of the computer industry to make better vaccines”*

#### Bad Examples
* *“Our company's core competency is building synergy between top consumer brands and their customers. We help these companies to upsell and cross-sell their products while delighting their customers with new products.”*
