:h2 Our Environment

* A little different because of the virus
* You will be working individually on your own computers
* Later on you will acquire a robot of your own
* Labs will all be on zoom
* You will be paired up, over zoom, with 2 other students to form a team

:slide_title Context

* These series of notes were written by me following the outline and content of Programming Robots With ROS" by Quigley, Gerkey and Smart. 
* In my opinion it's one of the best ROS books for students. 
* It has a great sequence on the concepts and then gradually more challenging projects. 
* It uses Python which is ideal for students. 
* The only problem is that it is a little old and so some of the instructions don't work anymore. 
* I highly recommend this book."

:slide_title Introduction

* Not really an operating system!
* Runs on top of the OS, i.e. Linux
* A highly sophisticated concurrent distributed process management and communication framework (my own definition)

:slide_title Installation

* No need to install anything!
* You will be provided a Cloud Desktop on our server
* Here are instructions for using [Cloud Desktop](https://campus-rover.gitbook.io/lab-notebook/infrastructure/cloud-desktop)
