title: Measure the effect of a pivot

#### Measuring effect of a pivot
* Identify the key 'stages' that users experience on site
* Example:
	* create account
	* log into account
	* add content
	* invite friend
* <%= discussion "What would stages be for our product?" %>

* These are not arbitrary!!
	* they figure directly into your eventual business model
	* depending on your goals and your stage they will be different
		* How many people responded to your email
		* answered your survey
		* answered a question
		* asked a question
		* etc.
* This becomes a classic "funnel" (sales, marketing etc.)
* <%= discussion "why do you think we call it a funnel?" %>

* Metrics... Metrics... Metrics
	* You also need a way to measure how many people make it to each step
	* Without metrics your pivots are a shot in the dark
* Once you have a baseline
	* Do the pivot
	* Quickly determine if you improved where you expected to improved
