title: Scaling by Database Caching

### Scalability Pattern: Database Caching

#### Example, Social Graph
* Classic Relational Approach
  * Schema (like all of you have)
    * User(id, name)
    * Follow(id, follower_id, following_id)
    * Content(id, author_id)
  * Nicely normalized
    * First, Second and Third Normal form
    * Origins of the relational database
  * Queries like:
    * How many people are following user X?
    * Who is following user Y?
    * What are the most recent "n" posts (i.e. content) for user "u"?
    * What are the most recent "n" posts for users that "u" is following?
  * But to display each and every user, a join is needed!

##### Measurement
* Ask database system to analyze SQL queries that are slow
  * e.g. `heroku pg:outliers`
  * Discover that the social graph access was very slow

##### Solution: Caching
* Use Network scale caching (Redis) to store and share across servers
* `count:followers:u = number`
* `count:following:u = number`
* How to maintain this number?
* How important is it that it is correct?
* What might make it incorrect?
* Add APIs in your code to maintain the cache
  * get_follower_count(user)
  * get_following_count(user)
  * incr_follower_count(user)
  * decr_follower_count(user)
  * incr_following_count(user)
  * decr_following_count(user)
* What class has those methods?
* Where are they invoked?

##### What Redis Interface looks like (more or less)
<%= code_begin %>
Redis::put("key", "value")
Redis::get("gey")
Redis::increment("key")
Redis::decrement("key")
<%= code_end %>

<%= callout("Teams", " Discuss and design how you would incorporate this idea in your specific nanoTwitter") %>
