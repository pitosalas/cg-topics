title: Participation and Warmup Assignments
---
#### Participation Only Assignments
<%= partbadge %> Some assigments are marked <%= partbadge%> as "Participation Only" assignments. They allow you to show that you are participating in class, by reading and thinking about the work. Your submissions are not marked for correctness but for participation. We require that you show a sincere *good faith* effort to respond to the question or prompt to receive a mark of 100. Otherwise you receive a mark of 0. (Non-pdf submissions lose 20 points, and not putting your name and assignment number will lose another 20 points, late submussions lose another 20 points.)

##### Warmup Assignments
<%= timebadge %> Some Participation assignments are further marked as <%= timebadge %> warmups. They are due at 10am of the day of class with no extension. The reason is that we review your responses before class in order to structure some of the class content based on what we see in the responses. (Similarly, non-pdf submissions lose 20 points, and not putting your name and assignment number will lose another 20 points)
