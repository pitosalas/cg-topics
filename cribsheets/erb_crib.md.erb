## Intro to ERB
* "Embedded Ruby"
* One of a class of 'template languages'
* There are many
* They do a simple job (used to be called "mail merge")

### What it does
* Erb file without any `<% %>` blocks remains unchanged
* `<%% %>` **must** contain legal ruby code!
* The code between the angle brackets is evaluated.
* *And only in the case of `<%%= %>` it's inserted into the resulting text

### Example
<%= source_begin "language-ruby" %>
<%% %w(Jones Hickey Salas Madeiras).each do |name| %>
  ----
  Dear Mr. <%%= name %>,
  I am writing to let you know that I have moved, and my new
  address is 1 Main Street, San Fransisco, CA. Please make
  a note of it.

  Sincerely,

  Tom
