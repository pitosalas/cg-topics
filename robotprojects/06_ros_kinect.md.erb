title: "Project: ROS Kinect"
desc: Interface a MS Kinnect to our robot to detect people and other non-fixed obstacles
---
#### Background
The long term goal of <%= link_to_intro :campus_rover %> is to navigate from one office on the Brandeis campus to a different one in a different building, on a different floor. We know that this is a really hard thing to achieve so we are working towards it in steps.

We have also come to realize that using simple LIDAR (see <%= link_to_intro :glossary %>) is not going to be sufficient, for many reasons. It will not work if the distance to the nearest obstacle is too far (say 10-20 meters). It doesn't do well in detecting obstacles that are moving, and other reasons.

#### Learning objectives

* Study algorithms and methods for detecting humans and other moving obstacles
* Understand the theory and algorithms of the Microsoft Kinect
* Understand the current state of the art of interfacing Kinect to ROS
* Run simulations using ROS and a simulated robot and Kinect
* Demonstrate our TB3 with a Kinect doing something interesting.
