#### What is a service?
* Very related to a topic
* Instead of "subscribing" and "publishing"
* Services are a classic "client/server"
* Node "N" asks a question of Service "S"
* Service "S" responds immediately with a result
* Services are good for questions that have immediate answers
* They are *synchronous* whereas topics are *asynchronous*
* Another way to think of a service is as a "Remote Procedure Call"

#### Defining a Service

##### Defining the inputs and outputs
* Analogous to defining the "method signature" of the service
* Very reminiscent of how Topic messages were defined
* You will find this example in the [rosbook github package](https://github.com/campusrover/rosbook)

##### Example: WordCount.srv
* WordCount.srv shows that it will take one input (string) and give one output (uint32)
* Notice some hairy tweaks of both CMakeLists.txt and package.xml
* Once done run catkin make (`$ cm`) to process and do the code generation
* You will immediately be able to see the service declared with `$ rossrv show WordCount`

##### Defining the logic
* It looks a lot like a node subscribing to a topic
* Big difference is that it has a 'return' statement
* In this example, it returns an integer equal to the number of words
* The money quote: `return len(request.words.split())`
* Notice the two ways of returning the result
* Everything else is plubming

##### Checking if it worked
* Run the service with a standard rosrun command
* Remember our package is called `rosbook` (not `basics`)
* Remember that you must have `$ roscore` running!
* `rosrun rosbook service_server.py`
* You can tell that it worked:
  1. It shows up in `$ rosservice list`
  1. It shows up in `$ rosservice info word_count`

##### A client Node
* It's a normal node (nothing magic about it)
* It includes code to send a request to the service (ask it a question)
* The code is more, but the effect is of a function call
* Impressive because it is inter-process and even inter-host - i.e. can be over the internet
