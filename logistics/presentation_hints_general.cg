:slide_bigtitle Presentation Hints and tips - General

* **Audience**: The audience will be your classmates and anyone else you want to invite. There will be a panel of Judges to listen and comment on the presentations. The Judges will give their feedback and rank the products

* **Logistics**: Make sure the equipment works. Bring any connectors or other gadgets you will need. Make sure your batteries are charged.

* **Dress**:  You should wear "business casual", no ties or dresses required. Whatever you feel comfortable with.

* **Tell a Story**: Each presentation needs to be self-contained, in other words, you need to make sure it tells a story with a beginning a middle and an end.

* **Here's how things are broken today**: It's often very good to start with a compelling problem statement, e.g. here's how terrible things are right now...

* **Proofpoints**: You've done a lot of research and spoken to a lot of people. This gives you critical credibility. Try to provide evidence whenever you can, with data from your own work or from credible online or offline sources. 

* **Empathize**: Remember this is the first time people see this. You need to explain and walk through Any diagrams, paper prototypes, demos and other illustrations need to be presented and explained so that the audience can understand and be engaged.

* **Slides**: Don't have too many words on the slides. Don't have just words, use whitespace and some illustrations. Don't read the slides. Don't have too many slides. Remember that your audience is seeing this for the first time! You have a lot more information than you can put on the slides.

* **Make clear when you are done.**: Have a clear concluding slide, maybe with a summary and ideas for further enhancements. Say "Thank you. And are there any other questions?" Keep to the time limit. Keep questions to the end. Work on the handoffs between the speakers to make them as smooth as possible.

* **Practice/Rehearse**: Please practice your part of the presentation at least a couple of times with your team. Be familiar with the material so you don't umm and mumm as if you are seeing the material for the first time. Watch your pacing. Speak clearly and in complete sentences. It's not needed that everyone speak, in fact if someone is uncomfortable speaking, has a very quiet voice, or whatever, it's ok if they maybe work the demo or be there to answer questions. But whatever you decide, you need to practice!

* **Performance**: A presentation is a kind of performance. Watch your body language! Are you energetic, engaged? If you don't care, your listener will not either! Keep in mind that no one has seen this presentation before, and at least one person in the audience has never heard of your project.
