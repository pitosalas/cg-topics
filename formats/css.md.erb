#### CSS - The Good Stuff

<%= include_image "/content/topics/images/htmlhier.png" %>

##### Intro
* Setup: Please clone [cssdemo](https://github.com/pitosalas/cssdemo) and you can play around with code as we experiment together.
* HTML is a hierarchy!
* CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets
* Key word there is "Style" as in "what things look like"
* HTML by itself, when rendered in a browser, shows everything in a vanilla "black and white" style
* HTML file linked to a corresponding CSS with a link tag in the head section of the html file: `<link href="css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">`
* You can have multiple `<link>`s to css files, and they act as one big file
* The following are **NOT RECOMMENDED**
  * You can have css statements directly inside the `<head>` section of an html file
  * You can even have css statements attached directly to an html tag, e.g. `<p style="font-size:200%;">`

##### Purpose
* CSS sole purpose is to add 'styling' to html pages
* Styling: color, typography, spacing, positioning, animation, and so on
* However it can sometimes look like it's adding major new functionality

<%= discussion_box "CSS experts: are these statements 100% true? Can you find exceptions?" %>

#### Syntax, in general
* Syntax of css is very simple, yet *very* powerful. Behavior can be confusing.
* How powerful: Look at [CSS Zen Garden](http://www.csszengarden.com)

##### Example
<%= ruby_begin %>
  p {
    color: red;
    text-align: center;
  }
<%= ruby_end %>
* `p` is the selector. Indicates what tag(s) we want to add the style to
* `{}` enumerates the styles
* `color: red;` parsed as `property : value`
* Don't forget the semicolon after the property:value (but not after the {})
* Note: There are huge numbers of properties and values: [CSS Reference](http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/default.asp)

##### CSS Selectors
* Could write a whole course just on them (exagerating)
* Building blocks:
  * tag itself, e.g. p, or li, or body etc. (see html doc)
  * class which is decorated with a period, so, for examle, .chapter
  * id which is decorated with a # sing, so, for example, #error
* The important selectors are just tag, class and id. The challenge is in how they are combined.


| Selector combinations | CSS |
|-
Element|`ul { font-size: 12px; }`
Class|`.front-page { font-size: 125%; }`|
ID|`#remark { font-style: italic; }`|
Compound|`ul#remark.front-page { display: none; }`|
Compound|`.front-page.headline { background: light-blue; }`|
Simple grouping|`h1, h2, h3 { color: red; }`|
Descendant|`.front-page p { font-style: bold; }`|
|-|
||**...there are more subtler cases.**|

##### Example
<%= code_begin %>
# myfile.css
p.warning {
    color: red;
}
# myfile.html
<p class="warning">
  It's important to remember to test the brakes!
<p>
<%= code_end %>
* Notice that it's really hard to tell what CSS does without looking at the related html

#### Box Model
<%= include_image "/content/topics/images/boxmodel.png" %>

<br/>

* Crucial to understand when working with spacing
  * `width:` applies to *content*
  * `padding` goes *outside* of content
  * `border` goes *outside* of padding
  * `margin` goes *outside* of border
  * See [Box Bodel](http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_boxmodel.asp)
* Works different for Inline vs. Block elements
  * inline elements (e.g. `span` or `a`) can only have margin and padding applied left and right (not top and bottom!)

#### Tools
* "Web Inspector" in your browser (Chrome, Safari, Firefox)
