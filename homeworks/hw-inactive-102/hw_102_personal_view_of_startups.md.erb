title: How do you feel about startups
---
<%= pdfbadge %> <%= partbadge %> **Read** Read these two articles: [The Bootstart Manifesto](https://blog.leanstack.com/the-bootstart-manifesto-65b41da6216#.dfeu5qxlk) and [Reconsider](https://m.signalvnoise.com/reconsider-41adf356857f#.vs8xa6c5b). The reason I am asking you to read these two articles is that each presents a particular view on startups. I realize that not everyone in this class wants to be an Entrepreneur and my goal is to help you think critically about those choices and how you undertake them.

    * Have you been guilty of thinking that the main reason products fail is that the idea wasn't good?
    * What about self-censoring (or just censoring) an idea because there's some competition, or because it's not important or 'big' enough?
    * Do you feel reluctance to try and "start" something?
    * Have you thought deeply about what "success" means to you? In other words, what is the  professional life you imagine when you day dream?
    * Do you work to live or live to work?
    * Which article speaks the most to you?
    * From which article did you have the biggest "AHA" reaction?
    * What are two or three key takeaways that have personal meaning to you?
    * <%= deliverable "A 1 page writeup on your reactions to both articles. Go for depth (saying more about fewer things) rather than breadth. Think about yourself. You can't answer all the questions I posed, they are there just to stimulate your reading and thinking!" %>
