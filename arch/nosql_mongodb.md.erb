title: NoSql and MongoDB
---
#### Definitions
* NoSQL databases:
	* Don't have tables, columns, or SQL
	* Don't have records and views!
* NoSQL databases
	* Have documents
* Notes:
	* SQL database world is far more mature: reliable, scalable, deployable
	* NoSQL database is still quite young
	* Terminology is still in flux
	* Traditional databases, e.g. Postgress, are starting to build in nosql-like features
	* Future is not totally clear
* When to consider NoSQL databases
	* When the rigid schema becomes a problem
	* Classic example: When a user profile has a multitude of optional collection of properties.
* Terminology (MongdoDB)
	* Collection: A collection in mongodb is same as a table in mysql or oracle.
	* Document: A document in mongodb is same as a row or record in any rdbms.
	* JSON: Javascript Object Notation is a data-interchange format. It is easy for humans to read/write and also for machines to parse/generate.
	* Key/value pair: ex: “name” : “nosql” :Here “name” is the key and “nosql” is the value.
