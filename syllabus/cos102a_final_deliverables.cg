title: (T) Cosi102a Term Project Final Deliverables
desc: Detailed expectations for final deliverables
---
## Summary

This is a team, multi-part deliverable. You should start looking at this at the start of the Term Project part of the course so you know what you are working towards. Don't be scared by all the words below, I am just trying to be clear and detailed. Questions are welcome!

Remember, 9 out of 10 startups fail. It is not expected that each project yields something that merits investment. The important things are the journey, the process, and what you learned that will help you be a better entrepreneur.

## Key Dates

* Final Presentation Day: Wednesday, December 13 2022 between 9:00am and 12:00pm
* Submit all these deliverables: Friday December 8, at 11:59pm.

## Final Presentation Day ("Friendly Shark Tank")

Several industry and/or venture experts will be invited to listen to each team do their presentations, ask questions, and have one on one conversations while we munch on snacks and drink delicious beverages.

This 10 minute presentation. Will be delivered by all the students on a team (although they don't all have to speak or speak the same number of minutes.) The presentation needs to be rehearsed and fit to the time constraint. Questions will be held to the end, and will go for up to 3 minutes. You can think of the audience as angel investors.

The Judges will ask to reviw the projects as if they were looking for angel funding. Their review will be based on the formal presentation. But your grade will be based on that plus the the additional deliverables described below.

### What Judges will be looking for

:callout :small, "NB", " It is crucial that the reader/listerner clearly understand what your product is trying to do and for who. More than once I've seen the audience puzzled about the basic question: what is this product and what does it do? Don't let that happen to you! Test it with friends and family!"

My instructions to them will be something like this:

* Students have been studying Lean Startup for 3 months
* They have worked in teams of about 4 on a product of their own devising
* They are given 10 minutes to present their business
* It is likely that they have pivoted at least once during the semester
* They have written a far more detailed report (but that you won't be looking at
* Please look for the following:
  * Can you really understand what they are proposing?
  * Have they done a credible job backing up their story with 'outside' data?
  * Are they persuasive in their presentation?
  * Consider the proposed pricing, growth assumptions, and market segments
  * Would you give this team seed money to develop the ideas further?
