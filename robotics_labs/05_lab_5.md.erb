:h2 Mini-PA: Robo Chaser

1. Launch a gazebo world with two robots in it, far from each other
1. Control the first one with Teleop (you drive it)
1. Write a ROS node which drives the other robot towards the first one, and keeps chasing it
1. Demonstrate the result to your TA

:h3 Hints

1. Use [this link](https://campus-rover.gitbook.io/lab-notebook/faq/spawn_multiple_robots#author-belle-scott) (or work from a previous homework) to create a launch a gazebo world with two robots in it.
1. Figure out how to control just one of the robots with teleop (just typing `teleop` in your cloud desktop will get you the tool)
1. Write a node which controls the other robot
1. Subscribe to the odom of the first robot and figure out how to drive the second robot towards it.
