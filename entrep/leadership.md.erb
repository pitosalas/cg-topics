### Leadership

<%= discussion_box "Bad news: I can't teach you how to manage or lead in one class. Not in more than one class. What is a Leader anyway? Have you ever had a good leader? A bad leader? Discuss what you remember about the traits or behaviors that each had. Can I be a leader without becoming like those other people? How can I be a leader and keep up my technical skills at the same time? Is there a place for a leader in high-tech society who never had any technical skills to begin with? If I’m a leader, will I have to boss people around? Can I learn leadership from reading books? Why do people see me as a leader, when I don’t feel that way? Why don’t people see me as a leader, when I feel quite capable? What if I don’t want to assume leadership responsibility? What is leadership, anyway?" %>

## Becoming a manager
* How does it happen? Think about how someone's responsibility grows
* Do you want to be a manager?
  * "I'm not a manager!"
  * "I'm not a leader type"
  * "I'll lose my technical skills"
  * "I dont want that much power"
  * "I don't want to boss anyone around"
* How did I (Pito) learn to be a leader?
  * Who says you/I are/am?
  * On the ground experience
  * Cliché: Making lots of mistakes
  * Reading lots of things. The best book on this topic that I ever read:[Becoming a Technical Leader](https://www.amazon.com/Becoming-Technical-Leader-Problem-Solving-Approach/dp/0932633021)

## What is leadership?
* Different, much more than, management
* Except in a few contexts (military?) the leader can't `make` people do anything
* Leadership: "of what?" and "to what end?"
  * Of what: the team, the available resources, the stake holders
  * To what end: the goal, the problem, the mission, the objective
* Is it as simple as: You are a leader because people listen to you and want to support you?

## Lead by example
1. Be Proactive
1. Be willing to make and meet commitments
1. Begin with the end in mind: `What's your outcome?`
1. Prioritize: quadrants of urgent/not-urgent/important/not-important
1. Be willing to trust so you are trusted
1. Focus on, and reserve time, to learn and improve

## Motivation
* Help the team embrace the goal
* Be in their shoes, and try to undertstand what makes them tick
* Re-articulate the goal over and over again
* Each member should understand why the goal is important and how their bit of it matters

## Delegation is hard
* If I did it myself, I could do it faster, or better, or at least I know it will get done
* Delegation means taking a risk and putting yourself out there
* It's not required that you know how to do the work you are delegating!
* Make sure you can explain clearly what is needed
* Catch someone doing something right

## Management Mechanics
* Strategy
  * Identify, understand and communicate the goal
  * True at every level
  * Prioritize, prioritize, prioritize
* Project Management
  * What are your resources: time, money, people
  * Be very clear in your objectives and communicate those
  * Allocate your resources in the best possible way
  * Monitor and improvise

* People Management
  * Hiring and firing
  * Communications and feedback
  * Paying attention to what's going on
  * Negotiation
  * Delegation

## Communication
* 90% of management problems are related to communication
* You have to be willing to have uncomfortable conversations
* Everyone is doing the best they can, given their circumstances
* Don't think you can read someone's mind
* It's good to ask for someone to say back to you what they heard, or to write it down
* Force yourself to talk face to face!!!
* It is very easy to have misunderstandings, hurt feelings or worse, over email
* Satir's interaction model (basterdized:) 
  * ear hears
  * brain parses
  * brain understands,
  * feelings arise
  * brain formulates response
  * brain generates words
  * mouth speaks

## Ideas / Imagination / Innovation
* Figure out and understand the essence of the goal
* Seek and communicate clarifications as needed
* See the bigger picture, put the goal into context
* Contribute valuable ideas to the team
* Articulate or re-articulate this
