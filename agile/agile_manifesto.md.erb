**The Agile Manifesto**

We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it. Through this work we have come to value:

* **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
* **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
* **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
* **Responding to** change over following a plan

That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.
