#### Good Programming
* What is "disposable code"?
  * Not designed
  * Incomprehensible 1 year, 1 month, 1 week later
  * Just barely works, no idea why
  * "write-only"
  * Long, ugly methods
  * Bad or meaningless naming

#### Rules and Slogans

<%= callout("QUOTE", " Know the rules well, so you can break them effectively. (Dalai Lama)") %>

* Slogans
  * DRY: "Do Not Repeat Yourself".
  * YAGNI: "You're Not Gonna Need It"
  * NIH: "Not Invented Here"
  * BDUF: "Big Design Up Front"

* Discussion about hard and fast rules
* Tools to automatically check: <%= link_to_topic :code_analysis %>

<%= include_topic :code_smells %>

* Other basic hygene
  * What's the right amount of code commenting?
  * How important is proper formatting?
  * Why is naming important and what is it's connection to commenting?

* ['Sandy Metz' Rules](http://robots.thoughtbot.com/sandi-metz-rules-for-developers)
  * Classes can be no longer than 100 lines of code
  * Methods can be no longer than five lines of code
  * Pass no more than four parameters into a method
  * Controllers (Rails) can insantiate only one object. Therefore views can only know about one instance variable, and only send methods to that object. (@view_presenter.user.username is not allowed)
