title: Ajax and Javascript Homework

* <%= zipbadge %> **Read and implement**: [FullCalendar](https://fullcalendar.io) is a fantastic and popular JavaScript Calendar. Create a simple rails application that does nothing other than display and let the user interact a little with a calendar. There are many resources on the web to help you do this. I suggest taking a look at [fullcalendar-rails gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/fullcalendar-rails/versions/2.8.0.0) as well as [Drifting Ruby on FullCalendar](https://www.driftingruby.com/episodes/fullcalendar-events-and-scheduling). We need to see that you have varied a little from the example, not just entered in the code as-is. <%= deliverable "Zipped up Rails directory containing your example, plus a readme explaining what you did." %>
