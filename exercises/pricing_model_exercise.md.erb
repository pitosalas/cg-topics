* 4 groups, random, 20 minutes
* You are a 10 year old entrepreneur running a neighborhood lemonade stand. You want to make some money doing this. What are some models that you could put in place?
	* Charge 50 cents per glass of lemonade
	* Chare 25 cents for a small, and $1.00 for a large lemonade
	* There are many other possibilities
* Work with your team on the following
	1. Come up with many variants of pricing models as you can
	1. Try to come up with a classification of those models, in other words look for the patterns, for example: what is being charged for, what is free? who is paying, who is getting something for free, what costs are fixed and which ones are variable, and so on.
* Prepare to present the results using the whiteboard if necessary.

##### Discuss
