## Use of the lab

<%= list_begin %>

<%= le("Keep Locked", true) %>

You have been entrusted with a key. Please respect that privilege. We are storing valuable computers, robots and things in the lab. Don't ever leave it unlocked even for a short while. 

<%= le("Use Lab Anytime") %>

You may use the lab whenever you want, to code, brainstorm, collaborate with others in the course. It's ok if you bring a friend in but you are responsible at all times. The lab is not a storage room. Do not leave backpacks, books, coats, computers or anything else there.

<%= le("Cleanliness") %>

Before you leave the lab, please make sure you leave it exactly the way you found it, in terms of layout, trash etc. There's a place for everything and we need things to be returned. Please be responsible, considerate, professional, adult citizens, and treat the lab accordingly

<%= le("No Food") %>

You should not be bringing food into the lab. Soft drinks and water are fine. Dry snacks like we supply in the lab are fine. But just don't bring your meals please.


<%= list_end %>

## Battery Safety

<%= list_begin %>

<%= le("Battery Safety", true) %> 

Lipo batteries can be dangerous if treated incorrectly. Incorrect handling of a battery can lead to fire (see youtube.) Early warnings are batteries that heat up, become puffy, make sounds etc. 

<%= le("Battery Mishaps") %> 

If you have any suspicion, first disconnect the battery from power, then note if it is hot or puffy. Immediately step away to protect yourself. If there is any danger then call 911 immediately.

<%= le("Always attended") %> 

You should never leave Lipo batteries unattended. If you need to leave the room they HAVE to be stored in the LIPO safety bags

<%= le "Chargers" %> 

Students are not permitted to charge batteries under any circumstances. Only Lab staff (Pito or the TAs) can do this. 

<%= le "Connectors" %>

When connecting batteries to robots or any other connectors, beware! Connectors should go together easily. Look at the shape of the two ends: do they look exactly the same? Is the polarity obvious? Never ever force the connection as this can cause shorts or overload situations, and even burn out the whole robot!

<%= list_end %>

## Robots and other equipment

<%= list_begin %>

<%= le("Protect Robots", true) %>
Please treat the robots well. Be careful if you put them on the floor. They are easy to miss. If you break it due to negligence, you will have to pay for the replacement.

<%= le("No removal") %>
Robots, Computers, Laptops and any other equipment absolutely should not be taken out of the lab FOR ANY REASON without prior approval

<%= le("No modifications") %>
You may not make any modifications, add any components, connect or disconnect any plugs or wires. No matter how safe you think it is. Please check with management.

<%= le("Keep noise down")%>
Our Lab is right next door to another lab where people work. Try to keep voices to a professional office level.
