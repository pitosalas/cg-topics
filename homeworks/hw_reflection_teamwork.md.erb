title: Reflection on team work
---
* Reflection and Peer Assessment:
  
  You have been working as a member of a small team. I would like you to reflect on that experience in writing. Here are some questions to stimulate your thought, you don't need to answer each and every one!

  How effective were you as a team member? Did you enjoy it? Sometimes people on a team take on different roles by virtue simply of their personality and talents. What role did you take on? Often in teams conflicts arise despite everyone's best intentions. Did any conflict arise in your team? Were you part of the problem or part of the solution? What did you learn about yourself as part of working on this team?

  Briefly assess yourself and each of your teammates on contribution to team organization, leadership, followthrough, and atmosphere. Give a grade and explain your assessment.
