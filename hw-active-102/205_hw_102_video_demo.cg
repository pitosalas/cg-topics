### Purpose

* You have been working hard on your individual projects and spoken at length mostly with your teammmates and your TA partner.
* You will be interested to hear what the other teams are up to and how they explain it
* This is a chance to get feedback from classmates about your progress
* And finally, it's a dry run for your final presentation


### Activity

* Create a 3-5 minute video explaining your product
* Use at most 3 slides, and definitely include members of the team in the video
* You don't have to have fancy production values, titles, fades, or anything else, unless you want
* The quality is kind of like the ones that I do for the class
* It doesn't have to be serious - Feel free to make it funny - try to make it engaging

### What to include in the video

* Name of the product and the teammates
* A brief summary of what the product is.
* Remember, the listener has never heard this before.
* Keep it simple, start at the beginning, and make it as clear as you can
* What is the biggest pain that it resolves
* Who is it for, and how do you know they want it
* What is the business model? How will it make money?
* Concluding statement
