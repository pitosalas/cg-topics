desc: Details of the funtcionality (looking from the outside) that nanoTwitter requires

#### General Notes

* NanoTwitter (nT) is a baby version of Twitter designed as a platform for experimentation with scaling issues.
* The list of features and URLs is quite incomplete. It is meant to set the pattern for you to build upon.
* All the URLs, both for the User Interface and for the Web Services API will attempt to follow REST design principles as far as possible.

#### Minimum nT Functionality

##### Users

* can register for an account by supplying an email, a name and a password
* are never deleted
* are assigned a numeric id (the record id)

##### Authentication
* All pages include login, logout and register links
* If a user is logged in then the link says logout <username> and otherwise it will say login
* Authentication will use a simplistic hashed password in the User record
* We will not be concerned for this exercise with having tight security

##### Non-logged in users:

* Will not be able to do anything other than register an account or log into an existing account

##### Logged in users:

* Can follow and unfollow other registered users
* Can tweet
* Can see the flow of the last 50 tweets by the users that they have followed
* Can search for a phrase
* Can see a list of users who are following them and who they are following
* Can see a list of tweets referring to a particular "#tag"

##### Tweets:

* Consist of
  * a 280 characters of text
  * a date-time of creation
  * zero or more @mentions of other users
  * zero or more "#tags of topics"
* Belong to one user
* Can never be deleted

##### Search
* A page with a search box
* User can enter a phrase or a "@username" or a "#tag"
* Result of matching is displayed
* Top 50 are displayed with next and previous links

##### General User Interface
* Basic bootstrappy html/css/javascript interface at minimum
* Clean but doesn't have to be fancy

##### Routes
* Home page page: `/`
* Specific user's page: `/user/1234`
* Search form: `/search`
* Display Full Text Search results `/search?phrase=`
* Display the user registration page: `/register`
* Display user login prompt, and check for correct password: `/login`
* Logout: `/logout`
