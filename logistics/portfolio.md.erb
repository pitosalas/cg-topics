#### Specifics for this course
* Name the top level directory **exactly** `cosi105b_<yourbrandeisid>`
* As you get assignments, you will be asked to create a subfolder with a specific name. Please use that name **exactly**
* For example, the movies-1 assignment for me would go here:
`./cosi105b/pitosalas/movies-1`. If you need further subdirectories for the assignment, that's fine.
