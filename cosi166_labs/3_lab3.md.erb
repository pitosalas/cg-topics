title: Heroku + Rails 6 + Postgres
due: 9/9/2022
---
## Plan for today

* This lab will be a guided independent programming session.
* Please do the following during lab while we are around to help everyone solve their problems.
* We are going to do this whole tutorial together: [Heroku: Getting Started With Rails](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-rails6)
* You can watch and listen to me do it, but I want you to really try to do it on your computer.
* If you have any problem you can interrupt me and either I will help you solve it or you will go into a breakout room with a TA.
