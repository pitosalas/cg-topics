title: Reflection on Computer Science
---
* I would like you to think back about your expectations and hopes about this course before you took it and what you know now. Write up a retrospective blog post thinking about questions such as:
	* To what extent has it lived up to them?
	* How have I changed my views on computer science and software engineers, and what it takes to be one?
	* Do I see a role for myself as an computer scientis, software engineer or entrepreneur in the future?
	* What have I learned about myself as a computer scientist?
	* How have I grown? In what way do I feel better prepared now?
	* In what way have I clarified what I want to do when I graduate? <%= deliverable "Write up your reflection as a post." %>
