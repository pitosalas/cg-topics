title: Active Record and ORMs
---
* Do research on the "Active Record Pattern". 
  * A pattern is simply a way of arranging code, a common way of solving a design problem derived from research as well as real world practice. This particular pattern has to do with ways of tying databases into object oriented programs in a rich and convenient way.
  * Read [Active Record Pattern](http://www.martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/activeRecord.html) and also [ORM Hate](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/OrmHate.html), both articles by a famous OO designer Martin Fowler.
