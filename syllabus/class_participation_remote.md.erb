title: Zoom Policies
---
Attendance is required either in person or on zoom. On zoom you will need to have your *camera on* and your *real first and last names* setup to be considered in attendance. Also we look for you to engage in discussions, both with the class and in breakout rooms. Also to make good faith efforts to respond to assignments marked as "participation" by submitting responses.
