title: Cloud Deployment
---

#### Classification of Cloud
* Software as a Service (SaaS): Delivers an application through a web site or app.
  * Examples: Google Docs, Basecamp, etc.
  * Differentiated by what the app is
* Platform as a Service (Paas): Deploy your apps to the cloud, based on their platform.
  * Examples: Heroku, Some AWS offerings, Google App Engine, Pusher.com
  * Differentiated by what the platform is, e.g. Node.js, Rails, Go, etc.
* Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): Delivers some part of infrastructure through the cloud. Infrastructure might be CPU, Disk, Queueing service etc.
  * Examples: Amazon EC2, S3, Google Compute Engine, Linode, etc.
  * Differentiated by what part(s) of infrastructure are offered.
* Pricing
  * These services usually have a free tier, but for 'serious' use you need to pay
  * Some examples:
    * Heroku: free for 'open source' (which I think means Public Github Repos)
    * Pusher: free for up to 20 simultanuous connections. (what is the lifecycle of a connection?)
    * S3 (AWS Storage Server): 5 GB of Amazon S3 standard storage free (see further details on their site.)
    * CodeClimate: Free for public repos
    * Github: Free for public Repos
  * Notice that the terms are not settled yet. XaaS sometimes is defined differently.
