#### Intro
Study [A library for OO thinking](http://c2.com/doc/oopsla89/paper.html).

#### Assignment
* Consider a system to manage a small school's registration system. There are students, faculty, courses, registrations, semesters and so on. Consider the functionality in your design.
* Obviously, Students need to be able to register for courses, not all courses are taught every semester, each course is taught by one or more faculty.

* Design a set of CRC cards for that system. Make sure the cards are legible! They will be graded according to how good or reasonable a design they represent. If they can't be read, then we can't determine that. Include a text commentary to supplement the images.

<%= deliverable "Take digital photos of your CRC cards, make sure they are legible, put them into a file with any commentary needed, and export to pdf. Submit it." %>
